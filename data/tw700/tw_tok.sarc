&quot; HOLY SH * T , marc . You &apos;re doing EXACTLY WHAT THE REVIEW SAYS YOU PEOPLE DO . You &apos;re making the claim without giving any explanation . &quot; &quot; OMG TEH SCEINCES IS ATHIESTIC BECUZ THEY JUST AER ! ! &quot; &quot; Thanks for making it extremely clear . Refuting a point by demonstrating it isn &apos;t very effective . Seriously , how disconnected from reality does one have to be in order to do something like this ? &quot;
But on the other hand , Genesis isn &apos;t a scientific document . No wonder . Why would a bronze age nomad from the Levant be aware of at least 3 tailless species of primates , or even the tailed primates from Africa , South America , and even Madigascar . If they aren &apos;t mentioned in the Bible , do they exist ?
... ? Either you &apos;ve misread what I said , twisted what I said , or you &apos;re just stupid .
Oh no . The main disagreement between theistic evolutionists and Fundmentalists is that Fundies aren &apos;t worshipping God , but a false idol of their own making .
2 , A. Myth ; Complete fabrication .
Then argue with yourself . Why bother having others answer for themselves
More silliness on your part . Think about it . Gay couples together for 40 or 50 years . That means they were living together in the 1950s and 1960s . Those people were the foundation of the gay-pride movement .
What does spelling have to do with your own opinion ? Again this isn &apos;t just about you although I think you did resort to correcting someone &apos;s spelling and just didn &apos;t answer the question . This has nothing to do with being entitled to your own opinion . It is equally bad for anyone to resort to personal attacks on either side of the debate .
&quot; Yep when about 99.99 % of a cows diet is grass ... I guess we should be eating that instead . It is hard to urinate in one corner of the toilet . If all ground that is being used for livestock is &quot; &quot; wonderfully transformed &quot; &quot; into grain production there will be many many wild species that will go extinct due to lack of uncultivated land . &quot;
And the resemblance of the bill of a platypus to that of a duck is superficial . You don &apos;t actually try to learn the basic facts about anything before you speak out , do you ?
Just because you don &apos;t hold the same beliefs as we do , does not invalidate our belief . I feel sorry for you if all you have to believe in is a small petri dish of algae . You do need absolute proof if your going claim it as the only possible way of creation .
&quot; Oh ! I get it ! abortion is fun , it is only a traumatic experience ( to kill your unborn son / daughter ) for &quot; &quot; unbalanced &quot; &quot; women &quot;
-------------------------------------------------------------------------- True , true , true.Iff God created man in his own image and i look like God then God must be in a lot of trouble .
Yes that actually did happen . And knowing our nanny state government where anything that could cause harm is banned we have it banned . BTW do any of you know of some great airsoft fields over in USA ?
But that is a misunderstanding of what the big bang theory is . What it isn &apos;t is an explosion . I don &apos;t suppose you have actually studied any astrophysics or astronomy upon which you base your rejection of the big bang , have you ?
So , whether the embryo / fetus / whatever-you-want-to-call-it has rights seems to be a non-issue . Because , for pro-choice folk , even if it has rights , it still is preferable to ensure that it can be legally killed . Of course , it is obvious to everyone that an entity does not need rights in order to have legal protections . But I &apos;ll let that slide for now .
Okay Yankee Fan . Keep pretending that it doesn &apos;t . Well , if you never read the article , you wouldn &apos;t be pretending as that would be an argument from position of ignorance .
Way to miss the entire point , Clerisian . My point was that is it a horrible experience for many women , and that I wish we could strive towards a society where abortions were no longer needed . Wishful thinking by a midtwenties female who just went through the most horrifying experience of her life , forgive me if I didn &apos;t clarify well enough . I can &apos;t imagine that anyone would disagree with that .
Oh , gee ! There goes my irony meter . It pegged and started smoking at the end of the first sentence . Archy is just being christian by trying to impose his twisted morality on everyone .
Link me to one saying weed &apos; addiction &apos; is worse than alcoholism please .
You mean like how you suck any rationale thought or discourse from a debate topic ? Talk about ABORTING .
Not much of anything else either , it would seem .
So you think Zeus and all the other Greek gods exist ?
Because parents of children without Downs never die prematurely . C &apos;mon Simone .
So montalban . Why don &apos;t you tell us about creationism . What is the theory ? What is the evidence ? What predictions can be made . We can assume that since you haven &apos;t responded to previous requests that there is no theory and no evidence . It is only superstition based on childish mythology .
And you have a right to cling to superstition and magic as true . But that doesn &apos;t make mythology true .
Golly gee . Scared already ?
* * Back to the dark side , eh , and &apos; argument by personal attack upon the character of your opponent &apos; ?
&quot; what about to d-y-k-e-s marrying each other , would you call it &quot; &quot; butch-ery &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
what other forest ? By your logic there would only be one left in the entire world , and it would be what , the size on central park ?
And that &apos;s what scientists will do . No change there , then . Now , on the subject of long-held religious views , how many so-called Christians will have a rethink when presented with new findings ?
Since when was having the gov &apos;t recognize a marriage a human right ?
&#91; quote = zsu2357 ; 361463 &#93; &#91; quote = Penfold ; 361428 &#93; Wrong . It is a precision machine designed to kill effectively . It can be operated by other than human means . Yes , you would be wrong . No , they don &apos;t . True , but nobody suggested there was such a grey area . We accept your word . I have never seen this , do you have examples ? So far as I am aware , nobody but you believes this to be the case . &#91; / QUOT ET phone home , fed-ex just delivered your case of 9mm shells lol .
And your Orwellian position is showing .
Well bravo for you - they must not be all that good considering . Or did you simply learn to be deceptive yourself and confuse that with deception by others ? Who can say ?
Can your intellect explain infinity ... such a tasty word
Just like you did with your astounding ignorance of erosion ? Fresh Organic Sample is just as old as centuries old time capsule because they are both on top of the ground ! Where do you buy your South American Villagers Dinosaur commercial art ? I &apos;d love to give some to the kids !
Here &apos;s some advice , if you &apos;re going to try and crack on me , make your &apos; jokes &apos; ( I &apos;ll be nice and call them that ) less passive and more active , grammar-wise . Crim- A definition is the meaning of word that someone created using their own opinions . Is there a difference ? And , a circle could be called a circle in the English language , but I could make up a new language in which a circle would be called a square and a square a circle .
And if that was the accepted rule for Constitutional interpretation we would still have Jim Crow and the 14th Amendment would be as useful as the 3rd . Total Fail on your part again Galileo . . .
And by old fashion I assume you mean Greece a couple of thousand years ago . That &apos;s the only place and time I can think of off hand where the populace ( by which I mean landed men in this case ) could vote to change laws . In this country the correct procedure for a citizen to change an unjust law is via the courts , and always has been . However , I don &apos;t think that is , in fact , what Jyoshu was refering to .
What about speculative and theoretical sciences ? Is a circle &apos; real &apos; ?
What about them ? Is this a question ?
^ This is the funny part ! .... My answer : .45acp strapped to your hip ... .05 seconds to respond to threat ... Crocidile Dundee &apos;s answer : Call the police ... 1-30 seconds to get to the phone .... 1-3 seconds to dial police ( if you have 911 ) 30 Seconds to 5 minutes to splain yourself ..... 5-30- ? ? ? time for police to respond .. My analysys : Your dead ! ! ! Having the logic bus mow you down : PRICELESS ! ! ( sorry Kelvin ... COuld not resist ! )
Oh , I don &apos;t know . Grow food in a garden , gather it from various wild sources , hunt game animals in the forest .
oh brother .. so what if a minority of americans wanted to legalize murder. this is rediculous .
So it &apos;s the scientific community that sets up communication within a society , and then the dumb old common peasants come along and screw it all up ? Hahaha – sorry but I &apos;m not convinced .
Hehehehehehe . That made me laugh , but you actually make a good point . They should have I AM JUST A THEORY written on them , otherwise kids will regard them as fact and then where will we be ?
I don &apos;t have to say anything here , your post made it sound sick enough . Yes , freedaom at all cost . Isn &apos;t that the theory this country was founded by ?
Well all you have to do is tell us the minimum time during which it could happen by NDS theory and then how long it actually took and we can compare the numbers . Of course you will have to detail how you arrived at both sets of numbers . Enjoy
You mean like they are happy wile having sex ?
&quot; I believe my wording was &quot; &quot; very rare &quot; &quot; . Please do not exaggerate my statements by mis-quoting me . But as you have mentioned it , care to produce some figures on the frequency of partial birth abortions ? Its just you have a habit of making over-inflated statements to support your arguements . &quot;
You claim god is unknowable ( partially or otherwise , it does not matter ) . You claim to know something of the unknowable , thus , you make a self-contradictory statement . Again . For what ... the third time ? Drop it , you &apos;re arguing illogically and I &apos;m embarassed for you .
And let &apos;s do away with these stinking debate forums ! So if it &apos;s silly to discuss that , what about brand of trucks ? Would that also be silly ? V10 Gasoline or 6.0 Diesel ? How big a tire can you put on a stock 3 / 4 ton truck ? See , you &apos;re right . It &apos;s just silly .
Oh thats not politically kerect and secially wif the chosen one doing the world apology toure I don &apos;t see that going down . Well lay a few on us sin baby . Give us the deal .
What illogical tripe . The above is factually not true . It &apos;s also the garbage that the Word of Faith movement hangs on to get people to conform to their message . Seriously , I act like a 13 year old quite often ... I only WISH I &apos;d become one ... simply becasue youth is wasted on the young . I also act like a God . Flexing my might and power on a whim . I &apos;m still waiting for adoration and worship . There is no &apos; act &apos; there either IS or IS NOT .
&quot; No , billsco , I &apos;ve never had an insight which would reveal the creationist mindset in the way you describe : I wouldn &apos;t mind seeing an occasional imp or two on my ceiling . I &apos;ve also wondered ( like Waxy ) about the motives of the scientists who at first patiently , and then satirically , address the &quot; &quot; arguments &quot; &quot; of the religious enthusiasts who so desperately want to trash evolution . Are the resident biologists performing an altruistic service or just entertaining spectators like me ? &quot;
well if you think the sun goes around the earth then its time for apocalypse .
&quot; Oh really ? Gun ownership allowed these &quot; &quot; lunatics &quot; &quot; as you call them , to become government dictators ? If I owned 50 guns and 10,000 rounds of ammunition , you &apos;re saying I could run the government with an iron fist all by myself , just like that ? Any random person can just appoint themselves God over the entire nation , without a single ounce of resistance just because they &apos;re armed ? &quot;
And you &apos;re accusing him of not debating properly ? That &apos;s the best you can do ?
He was probably an XXXXX to begin with then .
Just imagine Noah &apos;s checklist ! There .
Oh , well . Apparently you want to talk molecular chemistry whereas I was hoping to discuss organismic evolution . Too bad . Good luck with anyone who wants to debate your topic , but it just doesn &apos;t interest me .
And , I &apos;m sure you ask yourself that very question before you unzip your fly and whip out your pecker , right ?
And could you be anymore of a drama queen about it , using the raw sweage thing . That is such a stretch of the truth . People straight and gay have been sodomizing for years and their are very few cases of any of e coli every year . Stop drama queening out !
The Muslim invasion . You guys need targets right ?
BWAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH ! &#91; / quote &#93; So you are saying that my DNA reflects the fact that I live in Texas ?
Crammed with them , sure , why not ? It &apos;s easy , only a few million light years . The scientific method is used in weather forecasting too .
&quot; Well said . It is a disgrace that the &quot; &quot; Flat Earth &quot; &quot; side of the argument never gets a look in geography lessons and that the &quot; &quot; Spontaneous Creation &quot; &quot; side of the argument never gets a look in when teaching kids about the life cycle of insects . Do you realise that they refuse to present the &quot; &quot; Cheese &quot; &quot; side of the argument when teaching about the moon these days ? It &apos;s outrageous , how can our kids get a balanced education if such bias is allowed to continue ! &quot;
Well that explains your anger . I hope you are blessed with homeliness . Makes your commitment easier to keep . How old are you now ?
So , are you saying that all anti-gunners are fearless ? ? ? If so , , I must laugh .
You just say this because you want to murder helpless wromb-trapped human beings . You cannot just say you personally believe something in a debate .
&quot; Except that that would be the author &apos;s words , not a direct quote . Notice the absence of quotation marks ? Special Agent Newell never said &quot; &quot; 17 % came from the US &quot; &quot; . The author has as much trouble with the stats as you . 17 % of the total have been traced to the US . We don &apos;t know the percentage of the total that did indeed come from the US but is untraced or untraceable . See the difference ? &quot;
We have a terrorist supporter among us , objecting to restrictions on terrorists ! Why do you hate America ?
&quot; Well when the second amendment was written , &quot; &quot; modern military weapons &quot; &quot; were black powder rifles . Feel free to defend yourself with black powder rifles . In addition , what are the non-recreational benefits of guns . In other words , what would we lose by taking away automatic guns ( since I know your manly self could never part with every weapon you own . ) &quot;
No , think about what you just said . A cancer cell doesn &apos;t mutate , it attacks healthy cells and causes the destruction of healthy tissue . Kinda like liberals in a healthy society - they are the free radicals of the body politic , huh ... go figure .
Because deer don &apos;t live in Africa .
Mongoloid ? Is this 1937 ?
um ... gee ... its killing a baby ... now .. before 8 weeks , its not in the form of a human being .. at 4 weeks , its a fish .. at 5 .. its a rodent .. but after 8 .. its in the shape of a human ... there is no way around that fact .
&quot; Seeing the article you linked to was written in 2002 , over three years ago , do you think the author could perhaps incorporate the new data and rename his piece , &quot; &quot; Maybe There Is Some Truth About Pedophile Priests After All &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
Prove something besides your ignorance ? Homo-erectus and Neandertals differ in cranium size , bone size , bone structure , number of bones as well as the length and width of individual bones . I can see why people are laughing at you
So , you are talking an incredibly expensive drug that MAY work 20 % of the time when it is used . Are they just letting these people die .... giving them morphine for the pain and letting them waste away ? No
It also isn &apos;t a baby yet either . It is called a fetus .
1 ) It &apos;s Habbit . You could at least take 5 seconds to get my name right . 2 ) Considering you and your friends are the ones complaining , not debating ? 3 ) Actually , none of my posting privileges have my revoked . Try again .
and she would have been better by aborting the baby ? That makes no sense . Instead of seeing your baby die naturally you would rather not look and kill it yourself . The same person died no matter how you look at it .
So you still choose to believe that someone who &apos;s a victim of crime should be punished as if they committed the crime themselves ?
There you go . It &apos;s difficult to find which side of your mouth to talk out of when the facts are the facts !
And I just spent all that money on a new camera . Pity .
And when the President speaks in public we could hand out guns to the audience so that they could respond to any assassination attempt .
Oh ! Did you mean something like this in gun free France : http : / / www.guardian.co.uk / internatio ... ews + - + guardian Those weapons were cheap and from an eastern block country . Machine guns are for sissy American felons . Real felons in gun free France use anti-tank weapons .
All sin undermines society , including illicit gay sex sin . Or have you forgotten Sodom and Gomorrah ? Coming to a San Francisco bath house near you .
So you deny that this man is a victim ? Realize that the gunshot drew attention , and attention is something criminals don &apos;t want . Maybe without that gunshot , the guy would &apos;ve been beaten to death . But I suppose you &apos;d be happier , because at least the old man wasn &apos;t a gun owner . Or I suppose you think he should &apos;ve let the criminal have the money ; all that is needed for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing .
Don &apos;t count on it . Republicans do not believe in equality , individual freedom , or human rights . They only kowtow to their religious right masters . If Republicans trully belived in individual freedom , equality , and human rights the would wholeheartedly support this legislation .
Oh ? And what is the specific amount of pot you have to smoke before you become a drug crazed fiend ?
Not in matters of atheism . Tell me , when science discovers something that seems to agree with the 150 year old writings of Darwin , are the writings of Darwin disregarded ? Or is that type of history trumpeted to the masses ?
I thought you said that you had been following the converstaion . I guess you didn &apos;t understand any of it .
Oh , WW , come on now . If you say something to me about how Vitality works , and I say &apos; that &apos;s a stupid / simple-minded idea &apos; , are you seriously telling me you wouldn &apos;t take that as a personal attack ?
&quot; Then 99 % of creationists are not informed as far as I can tell . It seems that your position is that &quot; &quot; informed &quot; &quot; creationists are neo-Darwinists , fully accepting of the theories of evolution . &quot;
Atheists tend to ignore information they don &apos;t like also .
&quot; And you don &apos;t have any picture . You have no idea of what recessive really means , do you . Actually , since the first observation of a black peppered moth in 1848 , several other mutations have caused other variations of color in peppered moths . They are intermediate between the typica and the carbonaria , but they are extremely rare . These alleles form a hierarchy of dominence in which the carbonaria is the full dominant , and the typica is fully recessive . Please define &quot; &quot; kind . &quot; &quot; Please define &quot; &quot; variation . &quot; &quot; Please explain the origin of this &quot; &quot; variation in kind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Nothing like quoting experts willing to stick their scientific necks out , huh ? Or in your second quote : &quot; &quot; But it now appears the warming from greenhouse gases has been offset by a strong cooling effect from dimming - in effect two of our pollutants have been cancelling each other out . This means that the climate may in fact be more sensitive to the greenhouse effect than previously thought . &quot; &quot; Huh ? &quot;
I think that I don &apos;t have quite enough Tobasco in my Bloody Mary .
Yep thats true . There in separate buildings but right next to each other . I see it being about as attractive as a crack house next to a school with a revolving door in front .
&quot; Well , j , the blah blah blah part was pretty important . It said , &quot; &quot; Seife is referring to how information continues to exist in some form after it has been violently altered ; the smoke from a burning newspaper contains data about the newspaper &apos;s content , albeit impossible to reconstruct , and even black holes seem not to truly eradicate the information in the matter they consume . All of which has nothing to do with Dembski &apos;s claim ... &quot; &quot; which is true . One definition has nothing to do with the other . Blah blah blah. http : / / www.uncommondescent.com / index.php / archives / 903 &quot;
And YET ! The good mayor has the time , money , and extra man power to go to other cities and look for crimes ? Heck . I have been to New York , and he has an awful lot of nerve going anywhere else looking for crimes to solve . And what criminal enterprises has the people of his good city people supplied other cities with . I mean besides the crimes his investigators committed . Drugs , thugs , and murderers to name a few . Bloomberg , stay the heck where you belong !
So according to you , you &apos;d prefer it if only the bad guys are armed , because that makes it easy to tell who &apos;s the bad guy and who &apos;s the good guy ; being the good guy is never armed , and thus never able to defend themselves .
I see . So the Bible is true because you claim it is true .
Yes . What would a former Archbishop of Canterbury know about Christianity ?
And I &apos;m guessing by your misinformed posts that you have not been high before . Did you recently watch a film called Reefer Madness by any chance ?
So penfold and brady you are in favour of denying citizens rights even though they have not been proved to have commited any crime ? Ed Kennerdy was on that list so should he be discriminated against even though he has commited NO crime ? What is next putting black people on the list purely because of the colour of their skin ? You sicken me you two . Why on gods earth would terrorists be buying civilian guns when they could just use AK47 ? Did you sniff petrol as a youngster as you seem to have .
Well so is falling out of a building onto a piece of rebar . Or getting mashed in a car crash . There are a lot more of those than shootings but you don &apos;t seem to care . Why is that ? Is it because you love to dance in blood ?
Given your very poor English ( spelling , punctuation and basic sentence structure ) , I think the assumption that anyone can understand &apos; exactly what you are saying &apos; is a very poor one . Smiley PS I have highlighted some of the errors in latest attempt .
So the Establishment Clause was included to promote atheism , eh ?
and for you MIT stat loving freaks : http : / / web.mit.edu / ~ noto / Public / bk _ v8.pdf
oh , it &apos;s obvious that non-darwinists have no affect on you guys . Nothing will ever change your mind because your mind is not made up on the evidence ... it &apos;s made up on your worldview and your belief in materialism .
Just as being anti-gun won &apos;t compensate for being born with a small brain .
&quot; Really ? So , university presidents and trustees -- the overwhelming majority of whom have no connection with evolution , and most of whom are considerably more politically conservative than university faculties -- are behind the whole thing ? Wow . You know , this sort of claim requires evidence . I would like see your evidence of university administration involvement . Got any ? And who are the &quot; &quot; top &quot; &quot; in the peer-review process ? Editors ? Please explain what you mean . &quot;
78.4 years ? Well excuse me but I intend to live much longer than that . I was thinking about 112.7 years . Yeah . That &apos;s about right .
Time to get a helmet ...
Did I claim you did start the thread ? Vitroilic hatred , nope pity is the word you are needing there . No I merely pointed out your style of debate . Which I noticed you made no attempt to say it was wrong . Hence guilty as charged simone . Yep that would be the left &apos;s method for free speech . Speech you don &apos;t want to hear is banned . On the flip side any conservative speech needs a liberal counterpoint . Am I right simone baby ?
&quot; Well ... someone hasn &apos;t been following the campaigns for the so-called &quot; &quot; protection of marriage &quot; &quot; amendments , federal or state . &quot;
Well lets speculate about how many possible explanations we could concoct if left to supposition . I &apos;m talking about the only two explanations for the origins of life that have ever been entertained as viable empirically testable concepts in modern science .
So , evolution is falsified because Ford didn &apos;t draft chimps to work the assembly lines ? I &apos;ve never seen such nonsense paraded about with such pride . I &apos;d congratulate you on your win DamEtel , but I &apos;m more impressed with your patience .
To me , your point would be easier to decipher if you made a long story short . I &apos;d rather read your point of view on the subject , without reading a mini -series of someone who wan &apos;t me to feel sorry for them . Do people who choose to have an abortion expect a welcoming committee ?
That &apos;s so trite that it is meaningless .
&quot; You know , I &apos;m thinking of suggesting that they put a permanent link to an online dictionary on this forum. http : / / dictionary.reference.com / search ? q = designed You could take &quot; &quot; intelligently &quot; &quot; to mean that the being is conscious of what it &apos;s doing ; that it &apos;s doing what it is purposefully . &quot;
&quot; Funny . It is you who have &quot; &quot; abso-freaking-lutely &quot; &quot; no qualms about forcing gays and lesbians to pony up dough for Mr and Mrs. John Q Taxpayers marriage and divorce , all the whie denying them the chance to follow the same course as Mr. and Mrs. John Q. Taxpayer . You my friend are a complete hypocrite . Either give them marriage or quite taxing them to help yours . On another topic , I find it sad that you were ever given the position of moderator with your hateful and dishonest posts like this one . Very glad that it was stripped from you . &quot;
Sometimes the state of the education system in the USA makes me cry .
I think there are few better things than self-evident irony . I love it .
What are you afraid of , Trebor ? ? The whole world wants to know why you keep avoiding this question : According to your own Jewish Tanakh , is God the Creator of the heavens and earth , and man ? Will he give a pertinent answer or evade it again ? ? I &apos;m betting he won &apos;t answer the question .
Minor quibble . Omnipotence merely means that a being is capable of all things . It states nothing about how awkward or difficult these things are . Making a galaxy may require some serious brainsweat , whilst making a person may not ... Anyway , besides that I agree with you !
&quot; How were they able to get an &quot; &quot; aggravated assault &quot; &quot; charge pinned on you ? I &apos;m assuming she never had a mark on herself to show the cops . Had you two had a previous domestic call history with the police ? Hopefully justice will be served when you get your day in court . Then you &apos;ll get to experience the wonder that is &quot; &quot; family court &quot; &quot; , if you haven &apos;t already . You have my sympathies . &quot;
&quot; Oh , ok , I can be politically correct if it makes you feel better . How about I refer to them as &quot; &quot; intelligence deficient &quot; &quot; . And I was really not referring to bona fide &quot; &quot; retarded &quot; &quot; individuals ( those with true pathology ) . I agree that there is nothing funny about that . How about I refer to them as people who drive like XXXXXX ... Is that better ? &quot;
So the police can be there instantly if you have an intruder ? They can respond before you even call them ? Wow , you have some fast-responding police ! That &apos;s fine if that &apos;s what you want . But I &apos;d prefer take personal responsibility for myself and my family , thank you , rather than trust the police who may or may not be reliable , trustworthy , and likely won &apos;t be there fast enough to stop an attack before it happens .
Now , I could ask the same thing .
&quot; Then by that standard , christianity is horse puckey ! Christians contradict each other . Oh ! But wait . Anyone who disagrees with you isn &apos;t &quot; &quot; really &quot; &quot; a christian . &quot;
Proving , yet again , some Democrats are , after all , honorable men and women .
&quot; so we are making progress . It seems that SS is now admitting that evolution by natural selection really does happen . He admits that his examples are not what he claims they are . We also see that he objects for religious rather than scientific reasons and is aware of it . Good for you SS . Sadly , he seems to be falling back on that old creationist saw about &quot; &quot; where are the intermediates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Is there some sort of a symbolic potent phallic aspect to holding a gun in one &apos;s hand ? Is Sarah Palin being a manly sort when she shoots a wolf from a helicopter ?
Oh . Then you &apos;re just a dupe rather than being dishonest . Your information comes from a moonie . Funny that the Discovery Institute doesn &apos;t mention that . The fact that he decided to study biology with the express purpose of disproving evolution . So he had made up his mind that it was wrong before he undertook to find out what is was . Wells was encouraged by the Rev. Moon . He is known selective presentation of data .
Like you were raised ? Looks like it didn &apos;t work and now those hormones must be kicking in ? Nothing worse than a menopausal female grinding her ax ... their favorite victims ? Males .
* * Again , sez u .
Actually they apologised because it &apos;s a bit of a fad amongst the limp-wristed politicians at the moment . And anyway , the blood is fairly even on both sides .
Said like a lazy , ignorant person who would rather live off the sweat of others than go out and earn for himself .
You &apos;re starting to sound like someone who understands evolution . I don &apos;t see your argument here , you &apos;re basically supporting the steps necessary for natural selection . What you describe is one small step for evolution , you just have to repeat this 1,000,000 times over various other environmental and competitive contraints and viola , you &apos;ll probably see evolution at work on a scale that you can recognize . You &apos;re almost there montalban ! -Mach
&quot; So Starguy since you are obviously afraid of guns and won &apos;t go near , you don &apos;t have to worry about any &quot; &quot; violent testosterone &apos;s &quot; &quot; but if you want to be friendlier well you know how to do it . OUCH . &quot;
Please stop demonstrating your complete inability to understand evolutionary theory . How is Texas Stadium meaningful in the population of the earth ? Do various blimp pilots who soar over Texas Stadium have better sexual success than you ? You seem to be a bit of a sad sack .
Oh really the people who where behind the petition drive here in michigan want to deny me marriage , Here I will let the head of the organization that spearheaded the drive explain it in her own words. http : / / www.bpnews.net / bpnews.asp ? ID = 19408
And I propose we put lunatics who make threats to completely legitimate doctors in a state mental ward for a few years to straighten them out . As to the abortion issue , are the pro lifers really that willing to risk one of their precious fetuses over a traffic ticket ? !
And yet the post-Dunblane handgun ban happened after only one event .
Jesus ! Another scientific illiterate . The facts are the observations . And the point is not to test facts but to explain them with an hypothesis that suggests a prediction as a consequence that can be tested by experimentation .
I think maybe you have hit yourself in the head with the Bible a few times too often .
So you &apos;re going to live with the Amish eh ?
Gun Control is not on this list of crime contributing factors . However banning guns would leave the law-abiding defenseless in the face of these criminal predators . Why don &apos;t you work for changing these conditions instead of working for something that has no effect on reducing crime ( gun control ) . However , if you think you can prove gun control will work as crime control , then go for it ! Maybe you can cower us with your overwhelming evidence .
&quot; No , of course not . Instead , you call us &quot; &quot; liberals &quot; &quot; and then call liberals racist . &quot;
&quot; And it isn &apos;t the job of the school to teach anyone about your god . That is the job of the parents . If it is a good idea to teach about your god in the public school , it is also a good idea to teach about mine . How about Wicca and Islam . A good idea , right ? But if some creationists don &apos;t like their children learning science , then they should put them in their own &quot; &quot; christian &quot; &quot; schools where they can become scientific illiterates who think that heliocentrism is a fact . &quot;
So all the creatures you see today came about suddenly and fully formed ? And you observed this ? If this happened , the only one who couldobserve it is God .
So is Jesus , aka God , a liar ? Or was not even one of the millions of believers who prayed for Terri Schiavo &apos;s life to be saved really God &apos;s child ? Gee , I wonder how many people out there are being led by a pastor , priest , or what have you , that prayed but God didn &apos;t listen because that religious leader is a fraud ? Hmmm , maybe the rape or molestation of young boys , adulty , and so on , by religious leaders is more widespread than anyone could have imagined ? ! ? ! ? !
After reading that I had to go talk to Ralph on the big white telephone .
So when your God killed all of the helpless , little first borns in Egypt he too was another baby-killing liberal ? You are very amusing and naive .
Since animals can operate them , gun owners obviously need sufficient training to make sure they are used safely . It seems they need a lot more . On the other hand , the problem is largely self-limiting , since the cretinous owner either dies or hopefully learns from their stupidity once they recover from their injuries .
&quot; HELLO ! ! THAT &apos;S WHY ! ! Then we see the standard dance of how innocent and objective science really is . 6 ) And the standard &quot; &quot; theistic evolution &quot; &quot; dance . Atheistic evolutionists can &apos;t get along without it ! I wonder if Kenneth Miller will see the movie , and comment on it . I wonder if he &apos;d have refused to be a part of it . &quot;
So what else is new ? Does Texas support the death penalty ?
&quot; If we did not have criminals , we wouldnt have &quot; &quot; shoot outs &quot; &quot; as you so call them . &quot;
I think you and my ten year old could really connect . Happy Easter , Jim . You really are one of my favorite conservatives .
Mehhh .... You probably went to a Catholic school . But now that you &apos;ve stopped &apos; devoting &apos; your &apos; life &apos; to the God of the Bible , you &apos;ve &apos; devoted &apos; yourself to another god , Yourself . Typical case .
Perfect . A creationists caught repeating the same refuted arguments on different forums . Resistance is met , run like a coward to another forum .
So how can evilutionists have any confidence in carbon dating if they keep updating the calibration curve ? Huh ?
So what ? A person has a right to defend themselves , as spelled out in the Constitution . Or would you rather the 80 year old just get beaten to death for his $ 262 ? Or maybe you &apos;d feel better if he &apos;d suffered the same fate as the home invader over in Maryland . He made the mistake of breaking and entering into a student house and was slaughtered with a sword . And what point are you trying to make anyway ? It &apos;s not like the 80 year old went on a killing spree of anything . Nobody got murdered . So what &apos;re you moaning about ?
So , how many kids do you have ? And , do you know their names ? What they like to do ? It doesn &apos;t sound like you &apos;ve been much of a dad if all you did is providing for them . Did you watch TV sports the rest of the time ?
Try the ( Law of Common Sense ) . If your an ex-atheist , you already know the ( Law of Relativity ) .
Rather unsurprisingly , the U.S. constitution does not have any bearing on Australian law .
&quot; Argh . Atheism is no belief in a god , &quot; &quot; without belief in god &quot; &quot; . Why would you try to prove a negative ? Did you wake up today and believe in a UNI because you couldn &apos;t prove it didn &apos;t exist ? Richbee has a long way to go to &quot; &quot; prove &quot; &quot; anything other than his fondness for rhetoric . -Mach &quot;
Wouldn &apos;t it be wonderful if , in this male-centered world , drugs were designed to be women-friendly , especially pregnant women-friendly ?
Yes , the university one is quite possibly the most nonsensical . I will never understand why people seem to think that the mere presence of a weapon makes it somehow more likely that there is going to be a problem . I have lots and lots of guns , right here at my house . Last year , the murder rate at my house was 0 . I think that we can most likely maintain the same this year . What school are you at ?
Is this a rational statement ? If so , prove it rationally , by science .
So you &apos;ve got nothing to offer but a whining rant ? Just because you don &apos;t like it , doesn &apos;t mean that the evidence doesn &apos;t exist . By the way , why don &apos;t you offer some reliable evidence to support your foolish claims above . Creationist web sites don &apos;t do it for me . Peer reviewed literature please .
Really ? I don &apos;t think you know what you are talking about . Please provide evidence to back your claim . Thanks .
And you are proud of that ?
How do you know ?
* * It &apos;s up to you . Stop bringing up red herrings and / or arguing by personal attack , or don &apos;t expect me to treat your posts with any less contempt than I have for most of what &apos;s been posted to this board .
&quot; Just to be pedantic , a better analogy would be : &quot; &quot; If you are here , why do you have brothers and sisters ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
When &apos;s the last time you heard of someone being killed by the accidental discharge of a fire extinguisher ? Or when the last time a fire extinguisher was stolen from a home and then used in the commission of a crime ? And don &apos;t you think the likelihood of being in a car accident is greater than that of being required to shoot someone ?
&quot; No . Perhaps some effort into educating yourself would be appropriate . I presume that you expected a yes answer and your next question would have been , &quot; &quot; why are there still monkeys / apes ? &quot; &quot; I sincerely request that you look at all of the skulls in the following two pictures . Please give me your opinion as to what each of these may be and how they came about . Please be aware that &quot; &quot; GAWD DID IT &quot; &quot; is laughable . I am aware that you are usually free from thought , but please make an exception and think about your answers. http : / / home.houston.rr.com / bybayouu / skulls.html http : / / home.houston.rr.com / bybayouu / skulls2.html &quot;
Ladling out the guilt again , Maximus ? Don &apos;t forget take a large helping for yourself .
So , how many unborn babies did your God drown in Genesis ? Talk about hypocrisy .
Just helping something live doesn &apos;t affect evolution unless it affects the ability to reproduce viable offspring . If there was no nylon before the 1940s and there is an organism that can survive by eating NOTHING else , what does that tell you ? There could not have been a population of nylon-eating bacteria before 1940 . This is a new population that did not exist before .
http : / / www.talkorigins.org / indexcc / list.html Somehow merely clicking the link makes you look like a hypocrite .
You go to hell when you do not ask for FORGIVENESS from your sins and ask Christ to govern your life and help you to stop sinning . I am still a sinner , but I am forgiven and I ask Christ daily to help me with my fleshly desires .
Actually , it makes sense only to you . If you look at nature for just a little while , you willl become aware of a great deal of death . But it is mostly very economical since scavengers make sure that there is minimal waste .
Oh my goodness . This is a trick called semantics . I guess you got sucked in . Yes , abortion is used as contraception unfortunately .
Oh ? Since you are so inquisitive about my medical procedures , would you like the readout of my last yearly physical ? My cholesterol levels ? Whether or not my blood sugar content was high ?
So if everyone had a sign on them and a water pistol then would you be happier or does everyone need to have a gun ? Should everyone who has a gun have a sign as well ? Is the deterrent of a gun diminished without the sign ? I &apos;m also not going to address my brother in every single post . He is a shining example of why I don &apos;t like guns but that doesn &apos;t mean I &apos;m going to talk about him constantly .
Target shooting and handgun hunting , for starters . There &apos;s also self-defense , although not many people seem to have a great desire to defend themselves . If there &apos;s no legal use for a handgun , then why do all those cops carry them ?
That &apos;s great for women ! What about the rights of their children ?
Well , this guy is so bad ad arguing and so good at alienating people that if we sent him into the abortion forum , it is likely , he &apos;d be so ineffective at defending his pro-life position thathe &apos;d actually be contributing to the pro-choice position ...
&quot; Oh , I get it . So you believe , but you don &apos;t exactly &quot; &quot; believe &quot; &quot; . &quot;
OH FREE MARKET ? ? ? ? IM goin to take the embryos and fetuses slain in abortion centers and turn it into a new food source and sell it at the grocery store ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
Oh .. that makes sense . Because , it sounds exactly like modern day republicans .
&quot; Good . The less moronic &quot; &quot; spirituality &quot; &quot; in each state the better . Let &apos;s move out of the dark ages as fast as we can . &quot;
So both daughters get daddy * * * * * * , shag him and get pregnant . And considering that God smites people for just about anything and everything in the Bible , he seems silently approving in this case .
So they &apos;re failing because they &apos;re XXXXXX ?
60 % accepting Roe v Wade is a high figure don &apos;t you think ? More people support abortion then the president .
Try the link . You &apos;ve done the &apos; name calling &apos; , at least you could be honest about what you are doing .
hey , watch yourself ......... watch it ..
Zardozy , honey , whushoo gotta b &apos;lieve in ? You related to that Frenchie guy with the skinny wife ?
I &apos;m not going to go into what is wrong with the idea of God without knowing it is what we mean we speak the word . Excuse me if I am mistaken , but it seems that you are getting defensive on your belief before I even begin a debate . I &apos;m simply looking for any one wishing to participate on the nature / existance of God . If you find my questions to be complete nonsense and that I &apos;m only here to critize theism than you need not participate. thebootfitter ,
It &apos;s sophomoric remarks like that that hurt the gay cause in America . God isn &apos;t mocked , though . And I doubt the people are either . And I &apos;m glad California outlawed the sin . The only thing you have left is to hope the far left , spiritually-stunted judges in the US Supreme Court are pro Sodom and Gomorrah .
In other words , the author seems to think that because Mendel didn &apos;t know about genes mutating , we must continue to believe they don &apos;t . Complete and utter nonsense from beginning to end .
Well he can defend his tax difficulties by claiming he is a creationist and thus cannot be trusted with quantitative processes involving a bit of mathematics . Then again he can tell IRS that GOD will provide and they should contact Bush to get Gods cell number . I am sure that IRS , GOD , and Hovind can work it all out .
Actually , they have . But only Leviticus and Numbers .
Sorry did I say pacifist ? I meant yellow bellied pacifist.However if its any consolation , I meant anti &apos;s in general not just you Sinj.sorry if it sounded that way .
And the man who impregnated the woman should walk away totally free of all responsibility ! Spoken just like an total misogynist !
If we were to debate whether God made us perfect as he could have , then of course we can make the point that he obviously doesn &apos;t exist .
I see you know nothing about the subject ... hardly a surprise .
It is impossible to read something that can &apos;t be found .
Oh damn it ... and I was going to sell this joke and retire !
the cricket in the pliers feels pain ... When you start to squeeze a cricket with a pair of pliers , it starts to wiggle and tries to get away so as not to get crushed by the pliers . Is it because the cricket feels pain ?

And I would appreciate your refraining from calling your mythology a theory .
It &apos;s kind of funny that they claim this happened , but can &apos;t get the woman to come out and say it ?
You should refrain from calling others arrogant Mr. Kettle .
You made the claim . Another lie from the radical cheap seats !
So , it was a form of birth control ?
&quot; Doesn &apos;t matter if they &quot; &quot; give it up &quot; &quot; or not . They don &apos;t legally issue death certificates for abortions . Imagine that . Death certificates are ONLY issued to once living persons . OH WAIT ! ! ! I think we just proved that a ZEF is not a &quot; &quot; person &quot; &quot; &quot;
So if I come and insult and demonize you or somebody you love - you might still consider me a good person ?
Quick question - What particular qualification of Dr. Olson &apos;s makes his opinion on the subject superior to all others ? Given your fondness for posting this essay of his ( in his entirety ) as your ultimate justification , that should be an easy one for you . Waxy
And secondly , it &apos;s a bit rich for them to call it murder when a blastocyst can turn into a tumour . And oncologists murder tumours all the time ...

Wow , make up your mind . Either populations change over time ( evolve ) or they don &apos;t . Would your wingless beetles be able to produce wings again if they were somehow beneficial again ? You are starting to sound like Darwin and his finches .
Say hello to my little friend ! We the people , through our State Governments !
&quot; Oh dear , you are one of those people : a &quot; &quot; twit absolutist &quot; &quot; as you might say . Please keep your silly &quot; &quot; ism &quot; &quot; labels to yourself . &quot; &quot; Moral relativist &quot; &quot; is like &quot; &quot; rectangular square &quot; &quot; : it &apos;s a tautology . &quot;
Because none of these issues were raised in the Heller case ! What &apos;s the matter with people like you ! Your statement is like claiming that the Supreme Court obviously thinks abortion is alright because they didn &apos;t address the issue during the Heller case .
Oh , OK then .
&quot; So your answer to the question then is &quot; &quot; Nothing &quot; &quot; , Marc ? &quot;
I loved this part : So Miller says that ID is less worthy , scientifically , than even Young Earth Creationism ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
Wow ehat a brave new world you live in .... Now lets say just 1 % of all gun owners resisted ( in the us that is several hundred thousand peppered through the land ) . With media attention to such infighting between government and citizens how do you deal with this ?
&quot; And of course , the theory of gravity isn &apos;t &quot; &quot; physically &quot; &quot; proven either . Neither is the heliocentric theory or atomic theory or the germ theory of disease . However , evolution has been observed to occur and the current theories are the best explanations that we have for the observations . As far as your mangling of the &quot; &quot; Out of Africa &quot; &quot; theory , it would be nice if you actually learned what you are talking about before you babble such nonsense . &quot;
There ya go , Tither , three guys out of several hundred thousand ?
Just when you think WW &apos;s debating skills can &apos;t get any worse ...
So if Jitobear &apos;s mother had the option to abort Jitobear in utero , you want Jitobear to have the same option with any children she carries ? That &apos;s awfully progressive of you .
Neither are yours . * GEE * * gasp * * amazement * * realization * thistownwilleat-
probably because this is an abortion forum and not a forum about the Iraq War .. not only that , there is no parallel .
Bob ! ! ! ! You &apos;re bad ! ! ! !
&quot; So the real victim here is that society won &apos;t be as you WANT it to be , and that &apos;s the real &quot; &quot; casualty &quot; &quot; here ... Wow ! &quot;
I see you still don &apos;t understand what a strawman is . It is hard to have a strawman when the comment wasn &apos;t directed at any particular claim ....
http : / / www.nytimes.com / 2009 / 09 / 27 / ma ... 27tools-t.html In other words , a lot of these kids never grow up . And then they get guns . And , did I mention the hormone was testosterone ?
What makes you think I don &apos;t . Yours is not the only religion on earth ! ! And I didn &apos;t just jump to the concluision that your soul needed concern , so don &apos;t jump to it with me .
Tiger is entitled . Because of his money and fame , he &apos;s entitled to some hot and not-so-hot action .
Oddly enough , the Mass constitution reads : Article XVII . The people have a right to keep and to bear arms for the common defence . And as , in time of peace , armies are dangerous to liberty , they ought not to be maintained without the consent of the legislature ; and the military power shall always be held in an exact subordination to the civil authority , and be governed by it . So apparently they came to their senses later .
wow .... there is a real person under there . Good luck on your recovery , chemist .
Did you get another cracker polly ?
And amusingly enough , you who claim you don &apos;t have any interest in changing the outcome spend soooo much time posting on these threads ... Perhaps that &apos;s another claim that &apos;s just false in your opinion ?
But will you listen ?
I believe they got XXXXXX at all the conservates on this board . So they went and joined a commie discussion board where they feel more welcome and can send congrats to each other for being smarter than regular people .
&quot; Interesting how the study was set in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . They &apos;re a city known for violence and gang-related issues . I wouldn &apos;t be the least bit surprised if those that were shot and counted in this &quot; &quot; study &quot; &quot; were known gang members who were either shot by their intended victims , or by other rival gang members . &quot;
&quot; So you &apos;re claiming that you &quot; &quot; transformed &quot; &quot; from part of your mother to a human . So you &apos;re claiming that you were once almost your mom &apos;s arm or leg ? lol ! Biologically , this is simply a farce statement . &quot;
And that &apos;s why I think you are a troll . There really aren &apos;t any experts here . There are several who are knowledgable in a variety of topics , but that knowledge seems to me to be the result of being both educated and widely read . It also indicates an ability to reason and an open mind .
Actually the defending of ATF wouldn &apos;t do much with regular guns since they have little to do with them . ATFs function is with NFA guns , which you probably know little , or nothing about .
Well , I haven &apos;t mutated into some other species last time I checked .
So , in your scenario , Prototype , are you anti-choice folk going to force us who believe in choice , who believe that a woman owns her very own body , are you going to place us in re-education jails so that we , too , believe that a fertilized egg is a human being ?
On the contrary , the wet dreams of those slavering over these appalling British figures miss the fact that bad as they are , those 3 or 4 more murders in the USA per hundred thousand population equates to your likelihood of being murdered there as at least ten times higher than in that dangerous place Britain . Suck on that .
Wow , you PROVED the Big Bang to be a big dud ? I didn &apos;t see this clear refutation of a longheld scientific theory written up in any of the peer reviewed scientific journals . I must have overlooked it . Can you give the reference to your article ?
So cross jurisdictional escort is a fairly common occurrence in the area . You will note that it is not the local cops talking about not being informed .... it is the author of the article whining about it .
I thought I &apos;d give Brady and Penfold a chance to tell us what a bad man this guy was for defending himself like that . BTW , here in Alaska he didn &apos;t need to have a concealed carry permit . Here , if you can legally own a gun you can carry it with a few exceptions . Merry Christmas
Of course we can ignore all the emotional and physical problems women lose when terminating a pregnancy .
It &apos;s usually easier to take the immoral path . Stealing &apos;s easier than working . Lying &apos;s easier than telling the truth . Being a deadbeat parent is easier than being a good parent . The list goes on and on .

You were asked to give us your explanation of evolution . So far you &apos;ve just regurgitated creationist arguments against it , without showing that you actually understand what you &apos;re arguing against . But instead of trying to answer the question that was asked of you , you just spat out some more quotes . The least you could have done was to use quotes that explained evolution as you percieve it , but they &apos;re not even on topic , going on about morality and atheism ! You continue to confirm your ignorance for us .
Have you seen who our current President is ?
Oh no , it &apos;s not too complex for us to understand . So please explain to we simpletons how Intelligent Design is nothing more than animism . But first , here is the truth regarding this newest perverse propaganda you are promoting .
Well Spam &amp; amp ; Scram is certainly the strangest of the anti-evolution crowd I &apos;ve come across . He even proclaims that animals change as fact , not something that Creationists concede lightly . He claims to know very little then decides he knows it all ... ( OK that &apos;s more like a Creationist . ) It might be intresting to see what happens if he came into contact with Creationists .
And that is more likely than a magical being who poofed everything from nothing , don &apos;t you agree ?
Quote from your appeal to authority : ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
So , we on this board aren &apos;t receptive to your proselytizing ? Sorry about that . This particular forum is intended to be a scientific discussion , based on logic and evidence . We certainly don &apos;t want to waste your time . The door is over there . I find your dismissive , superior attitude to be offensive , to be honest . , so I can &apos;t say I &apos;ll miss you . But should you ever want to discuss evolution and creation in terms of actual science you will be welcome to return .
If you had bothered to spend more than two seconds actually looking up what happened , you would &apos;ve seen that Joe Horn was cleared of all wrong doings by a grand jury , not on the grounds of the new Castle Doctrine of Texas , but the already existing laws that permits the use of deadly force for preventing property crimes . These laws were on the books for years before Texas officially adopted the NRA endorsed Castle Doctrine . And even so , what &apos;re you complaining about ? Would you rather Joe Horn be the one killed and the criminals alive today ?
You mean to tell me you would deny a life to be lived out and someone to get away with a harmful crime ? ? wow , sounds like a liberal to me ..
See , this is where reading the page would have helped you out alot . No where does it say that organisms evolve with a changing environment . That &apos;s what WW would like it to say , but it says nothing of the sort . All it talks about is a different approach to modeling cell behavior . Critical reading skills , they &apos;re really essential if you &apos;re going to try to debate science .
When is science going to get started on the book of Exodus ? Job ? Proverbs ?
&quot; Oh no ! Here comes Palin , run for cover . Because I really fear ignorant and hypocritical conservatives . As to your argument , while were out calling fertilized eggs &quot; &quot; men &quot; &quot; , lets call plant life &quot; &quot; men &quot; &quot; as well . &quot;

Current &apos; treatment &apos; includes : Use of a placebo Laying on of hands Prayer Tossing salt over thy shoulder Planting 3 kernels of rice in the ground under your home Saying the Pledge of Allegience And thanking the Obamasiah for a bountiful crop of beets . Oh , and if you can locate the witch , have her confess to the crime of making you ill ... and punished for doing so ... you stand a better chance of living longer with said cancers .
We &apos;ve answered these questions already over and over again and you &apos;ll get the same ones as well .
Duh ! You don &apos;t seem to have a grasp on what science is . Science isn &apos;t a search for truth . It is an attempt to explain observations naturalistic events without appeals to gods , angels , or demons .
Women &apos;s rights actually exist , unlike the Christian God .
Maryland already has the law on the books . It &apos;s effect thus far has only been to eliminate certain makes and models from the Maryland marketplace and to extinguish the sale of certain collectables .
and thats just kiddish !
we should turn this entire forum into a mythical / religion vs mythical / religion origin debate. let &apos;s see how well the creationists here do against Hindu , Norse , Egyptian , Zoroastrian , Manichean , Yezidi and the whole host of other religion &apos;s beliefs of origin .
People with big egos have libidos that keep up. what &apos;s new ? It &apos;s an unfortunate accompanying characteristic . The only reason that this was even posted was because it was another attempt to discredit anyone that is against gay marriage . The fact that most politicians cheat isn &apos;t a revelation .
&quot; Yea , and so is gardening . Both are &quot; &quot; murdering &quot; &quot; living things . Both do not mentally exist . A strand of DNA is the only difference , which isn &apos;t very much . &quot;
&quot; Archie , why should anyone even bother with you ? You ask someone to explain polystrate fossils-three people do . You plug your ears and go &quot; &quot; la-la-la , I can &apos;t hear you &quot; &quot; , then demand that someone explain polystrate fossils . Someone else posts 100 categories of evidence against a global flood , and you wave it away as &quot; &quot; evo lies &quot; &quot; . Yet you demand we take your biased site at face value . I swear , you get dumber by the minute . &quot;
Well I guess you apparently trust the political bunch and rich and famous .
Ahh . Now I see why you turned into an agnostic , if you even believed Christianity in the first place .
Really . Have you got any quotes from them endorsing monopolies ?
However , that would make supersport a comic genious . Tough call . Waxy

They can &apos;t , if you value science and common sense , however , science and common sense are irrelevent in their world .
And from where did you get this idea ? Please provide your references .
So it doesn &apos;t matter that someone dies in their forties from hunger and cold because they are homeless and penniless , whilst another lives in luxury with the best food and medicines until his 80s : they are both equal ? What planet do you live on , for it sure aren &apos;t the real world ...
So when somebody with bad intentions breaks and crawls in through a window , and shuts off your power so you can &apos;t use the telephone , and comes busting through your basement door , shooting them is vigilante justice ? To you this situation doesn &apos;t qualify as self-defense ? I highly doubt the woman is lying about the entire matter , because if she was the prosecuting attorney and the police wouldn &apos;t be so willing to not press charges against her .
Who is killing children ? Except for George Bush who has seen to the killing of thousands of children in Iraq .
&quot; No biggie , right ? Typical creationist &quot; &quot; teach the controversy &quot; &quot; stuff . But wait ! The &quot; &quot; encyclopedia &quot; &quot; follows this up with it &apos;s damning evidence to show the many holes in the ToE ! Read on evolutionists , and despair ! ! &quot;
Before you were claiming it was a slippery slope . Now you &apos;re claiming it &apos;s a strawman . Perhaps you don &apos;t understand what either term means .
Oh , it certainly is an issue . Martin Killias , a Swiss criminologist , did find a link between gun ownership and homicide in Switzerland . However , my point was to ask you if you would be willing to abide by such regulations . The law in Switzerland requires that military weapons kept in the home be unloaded and stored under lock and key . I don &apos;t think Switzerland is a gun-nut utopia .
LOL . “ Bats haven &apos;t evolved in millions of years ”
You may not have intended to , but you &apos;ve given your carte blanche support for a woman to do what ever with her she wishes , with regards to her family - and you &apos;d stick out of it , regardless . Also , interestingly , there &apos;s no man in this &apos; idealy free &apos; family of yours .
Again , as an ignorant layman , I can only get the gist of this material , but how anyone could possibly argue against the genetic code as a product of intelligent design is beyond me .
But what if it is unconstitutional , like Prop . 8 ? No , it doesn &apos;t . Are you saying homosexuals aren &apos;t American ? Are you saying that more of gay &apos;s right should be stripped , including that of protest ? How dare them fight for their own freedoms ? I should lend you my time machine , and you should go tell this to Malcom X. And you still haven &apos;t responded to my post .
&quot; I see , we just keep on adding legs until they match . BTW , they walk on those &quot; &quot; jumping &quot; &quot; legs also . Why are they not refered to as &quot; &quot; Walking / Jumping &quot; &quot; legs . However , if you feel you need to conqure another contradiction , here &apos;s a couple more . How long did Jesus stay ressurected ? Luke says one day , Acts says Forty days . ------------------------------------------------ Using a literal reading and the Gospels , recreate a timeline of the crucifixion of Jesus . &quot;
Oh yeah , generalizations are cool ! Let &apos;s all jump on this bandwagon ! Black people bad , white people good . Muslims bad , Christians good . Fission bad , fusion good . Geez .

It surely doesn &apos;t sound like he &apos;s a Nazi to me , but then again , I don &apos;t suffer from paranoid delusions either .
Over the Internet that can be a particularly difficult call ...
Yes they sure will .... with what 776 accidental deaths last year due to guns as opposed to 3,402 accidental drownings seems like more should be spent on preventing drownings than guns . But if your intellect is not up to understanding hyperbole ( literary form of exageration to express a point ) I will try in the future to keep it down to your level .
&quot; Oh really , so blowing yourself and a bunch of other innocent people up in the name of Allah is a &quot; &quot; great teaching &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
Really , did it take long ? ROFL . Did they turn grass into a tree or maybe rice into a tomato ? Got pics ?
&quot; What , to be &quot; &quot; open-minded ? &quot; &quot; or to embrace your definition of &quot; &quot; tolerance ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
My money is on parents as singular .
Yep . They &apos;re free to marry a member of the opposite sex just like any other American .
Hmmm ... interesting . Where does this inalianable right derive from and how does it really work ? I mean , clearly you cannot create your own army called Islamic Jihad of Al queda Supporters and start to develop weapons of mass destruction on your own farm , regardless if that organisation actually interfer with someone else . As for bootlicking Please drop the rethorics and explain how you mean instead .
You must know a lot of Abortionist to make that claim . And Obviously they must have had you &apos; round for dinner to know how much they make and where they live . If you have so many Abortionist friends then why are you so anti choice ?
I believe we have a human responsibility to one another . That we are our brother &apos;s keeper . Tell me , Bassman , if there aren &apos;t enough jobs , and the costs of medical care are skyrocketing through the roof , what do you suggest your fellow Americans do ? Just drop dead ?
Am i stupid or something ... whats a YEC ? Young Energetic Children ? Yacking Economistic Critters Yummy expensive cupcakes ? Maybe im just dumb or something ... i hope it was one of those three for my sake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; attack on the definition of marriage &quot; &quot; ? Why is it an &quot; &quot; attack &quot; &quot; to include gay couples in as married ? Would it be an &quot; &quot; attack &quot; &quot; on something for blacks to not have to be segregated from whites ? &quot;
Actually , shootings happen because a person points a firearm at someone and pulls the trigger . This is illegal . You can &apos;t make it more illegal than it already is . Shootings do not happen because of gun happy nuts running around . Nobody has ever been injured anywhere by any gun happy nut running around . Many have been injured by criminals who disobey the law . As far as puncture wounds , do stabbings count ? Or , as it appears , are you only concerned with those caused by firearms ?
Where &apos;d Noah get Tasmanian tigers ?
But maybe god does not hate gays , maybe he just hates the ones that demand to have sex with people whether they want it or not .
How would I fill in some of the gaps ? Here was my sequence : something like unicellular life to multi-cellular life , random multi-cellular conglomerations to an amoeba , to a fish , to a dinosaur , to a mammal , to an ape , and finally to a man ? ?
&quot; But why ? What is so important about an embryo that it can be given a &quot; &quot; person &quot; &quot; status ? &quot;
http : / / www.thelizlibrary.org / liz / 004.htm Normal , frequent or expectable temporary side effects of pregnancy : * exhaustion ( weariness common from first weeks ) * altered appetite and senses of taste and smell * nausea and vomiting ( 50 % of women , first trimester ) * heartburn and indigestion * constipation * weight gain = snip =
This should be in the science section , not the CvE section . Don &apos;t give SS any more reason to believe that the big bang is part of biology .
And you , on the other hand , because you are not educated in science in general , and evolutionary theory ( why the quotation marks ? ) specifically , are qualified to correct those of us who spent years in study of the topic .
He wasn &apos;t discussing abortion nor was He promoting it . He was declaring war on an unclean people whom He commanded the Jews to wipe out in a time of WAR . Again you rip an event out of context and attempt to imply God was endorsing abortion .
Seriously ? That &apos;s your reasoning ? By such logic , swimming with sharks means that humans always have coexisted with sharks , including the ancient ones that preceded the dinosaurs . By such logic , since humans can coexist with insects , we must have been around during the carboniferous period .
&quot; Oh I &apos;m so sure that &apos;s the case . &quot; &quot; Well the economy &apos;s at the worst I &apos;ve ever seen and I don &apos;t have a job and can &apos;t possibly provide a living for my family and we &apos;re in danger of losing our house and living on the streets , but I don &apos;t think I &apos;ll save us all a lot of pain and agony because I don &apos;t have a gun meaning that it &apos;ll just be too much work to kill ourselves . &quot; &quot; Yeah right , like a lack of having a gun would &apos;ve kept this family from dying in this instance . Your comments cheapen the value of life . &quot;
It seems that the high priest of Global Warming is so unconcerned about its reality that In the past year , Gore &apos;s home burned through 213,210 kilowatt-hours ( kWh ) of electricity , enough to power 232 average American households for a month. http : / / news.newsmax.com / ? SKIDYNyQ-GW ... mo _ code = 6539-1
Then their arguments are based on sheer ignorance .
&quot; Oh , right . And what would yours be ? &quot; &quot; We the humble people of the human species have decided to break away from Britan rule and form our own bubble community . No one has any rights whatsoever , and we restrict our citizens to living in bubbles because we cherish each life , from skin cells to bacteria to plants to embryos . In fact , we really have no purpose in life , we just life to not kill other lives . &quot;
I know you don &apos;t . So what ?
I think you could teach gun-control at a gun-free school , too . Sex-education is also taught in schools that forbid their pupils to couple on the school yard .
Marilyn - I &apos;ll look at your site if you look at mine ... http : / / www.nra.org /
Blah , blah . So you looked something up . Adds nothing .
So what ? The allele frequency , even in your example has still changed . A change in an allele frequency in a population over time is , by definition , evolution . What did you think that evolution was ?
So it is claimed .
Yeah they were . Mostly killed by criminals with guns . Now prove that any legislation that Obama could have enacted would have prevented those deaths . I &apos;m not holding my breath and I &apos;m not expecting a rational response either ...
Read THIS slower :
&quot; So doing a detailed study of something requires that one takes a class for it in a university and reads books papers written on it by &quot; &quot; real scientists &quot; &quot; ? Wow , I never knew that . Thanx for enlightening me . &quot;
Well you better hurry up . Aren &apos;t you like 113 years old or something ?
Oh , well , that convinces me .
My pursuit of happiness is denied by trees existing . Let &apos;s burn them down and destroy the environment . It &apos;s much better than me being unhappy .
Yes , socialist . Check the definition . I don &apos;t watch Fox . Is that the best you can do ?
&quot; Actually , no , they do NOT . The first three ALL describe God causing them - are you saying the bible is describing God &apos;s actions negatively ? Or are you saying that killing your precious foetuses is just fine as long as the persons carrying them are &quot; &quot; wicked &quot; &quot; . Sorry , but you need to get an argument , Phyllis . + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + Spelling and grammar for this post has been checked and cleared + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + &quot;
So if genesis can &apos;t explain some things then it is false ? Ok , genesis , and all you theologians out there , a quick question off the top of my head . Using only scripture , please explain why dinosaurs are extinct .
So in other words , you &apos;re saying that somewhere along the lines , God changed his mind .
90 % of the people in the world are Christians ? XXXXX-
haha ... I &apos;ll remember this next time I think of accusing you of spitting in one direction
In other words youre happier because the old man did something criminal and broke the law . Admit it .
Repeating superstitious nonsense makes it no less mythological than the first , second and third time you were shown it to be so . Skeletons , even from the BRONZE age , let alone your incorrect reference to the stone age , are not fossils .
Because of course , ... people with genetic malady &apos;s have no right to their lives anyway . Right ?
Oh joy another drive by with absolutely no proof or evidence .
&quot; Again , &quot; &quot; THE MOST OVERTURNED COURT IN HISTORY &quot; &quot; &quot;
So you are not an American ? You believe that your religion should be forced on everyone by the government ? Is it OK if I am allowed to teach your children my religion ?
&quot; You mean &quot; &quot; No ! sex &quot; &quot; , &apos; til you want * response-ably * to nurture a baby . What novel ideas ! &quot;
Is that the entire Pro-Choice objection ? Is that the whole Pro-Choice argument ? Does it really boil down to a question of pregnancy versus death , rather than slavery versus death ? If so , I am Pro-Life .
but you too are a figment of my imagination , and you only think you are a giant alien dreaming about this world because i imagined you as such. you cannot disprove this either .
My bad , Daewoo . How inconsiderate of me !
&quot; Oh my stars and garters . He actually admitted what &quot; &quot; the real issue &quot; &quot; is . &quot;
I dunno . Those Priuses are so small inside and out . How much explosive compound could Hasan fit into the thing and still be able to get in and drive it ?
How is mythology relevant ?
Yes . It &apos;s part of this massive conspiracy . We &apos;re trying to thin out your population so we can take Australia for our own .
Well , thank you for the riveting example of Poe &apos;s law in action . Parody or actual argument ? Only the poster knows for sure .
&quot; If blacks are offered a bus ride , why does it matter where they sit while they are on the bus ? They get all the same benefits . What &apos;s the beef ... except that you can &apos;t say that you &apos;re at the &quot; &quot; front of the bus &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
Way to go NRA , makes um look good ya know , kinda like they can give a little here and there .
I take it you have no understanding of science , much less the scientific method ?
According to Montalban , he doesn &amp; # 8217 ; t use sarcasm and quite often bitterly complains when I use it . Opps , maybe he made a mistake and is trying to cover it up . LOL
Math is confusing too , doesn &apos;t mean we should get rid of it .
&apos; &apos; No , actually the earth is 150 years old . FACT . And its age never changes . FACT . &apos; &apos; -Chris Formage , Grand Theft Auto : San Andreas .
oh please dont give me that XXXX ... its so great that you can try to turn that whole statement and point at me being at fault but that in and of itself shows you are at fault because you think that without your way the world would cease . Honestly , the world has lived without gay marriage its whole existence .... so why implement it now ? ? SHouldnt that say something about the human race when it steeps so low to want to call homosexuals married couples ?
so why is population control a good arguement for abortion ? Why don &apos;t we kill old people too ...
I see . So , you know the souls of others ? and how God will judge them ? Interesting . That certainly does settle a few things ....
He or she is still subject to attracting a mate more effectively than other monkeys , as a step toward producing offspring more effectively via any number of mechanisms .
Oh ye of little faith . I &apos;m sure he &apos;s capable of being much more stupid than that !
And a lot of blacks were killed through hangings . Are you against rope vendors ?
&quot; And would you care to tell us just what those &quot; &quot; official ideological goals &quot; &quot; are and where we might find a certifiable copy of them ? &quot;
Like talking to Richard ?
And God lives in Heaven , with Jesus sitting on the right side of Him .
As the great Spock said Logic dictates that logic need not apply in this situation .
But apparently they can &apos;t say no to renting the property for a gay wedding , even if they decide to just say &apos; no &apos; to everyone and get out of business. go figure
&quot; No . Anyone who sticks to beliefs that a god created the earth just 6,000 years ago is an XXXXX . People are free to believe that a god created the Earth billions of years ago though without deserving the &quot; &quot; XXXXX &quot; &quot; label . Hope this clarifies things for you . &quot;
&quot; This is not to say that every current dictionary includes such a definition ... yet ... but a number of major on-line ones demonstrably do , and to my knowledge human civilization has yet to suffer any negative effects . ( By the way , the above entries also include the typical &quot; &quot; husband and wife &quot; &quot; kind of arrangement as well . Funny how words can have more than one meaning , isn &apos;t it ? ) &quot;
Oh yes , Mr Behe makes a comfortable living out of selling to the ignorant . His newest book is just a rehash of his old book , and has the very same flaws that have been destroyed over and over again . As for your &apos; religious authors &apos; being respected .. they are respected perhaps by the fundamentalists that do not understand what science is about .
If this is your stance , then it &apos;s your job to prove it correct . Show us that Britain is just fine , show us that the criminals aren &apos;t awarded more protection than their victims . Show us thimble head . Show us or shut up .
What &apos;s your point ? Unicorns breathe toxic gas and have low density , so they can get around all they want .
I believe that this is what they call &apos; sarcasm &apos; . As for the second part of your comment , why am I not surprised ?
&quot; You forgot one . For trying to bring eugenics to the US . We wouldn &apos;t want those &quot; &quot; poor negros &quot; &quot; reproducing now would we ? &quot;
I believe murder is wrong , and there shouldn &apos;t be any of it in a perfect world , but i &apos;m not going to force my morality down your throat and force you to abide to MY principals while demanding you abandon your own . But it &apos;s not about me , it &apos;s about the person being killed . Think about it .
So I can take this as a quote to use for you in the future to show you that ( at one time ) you didn &apos;t disagree with that argument ? Good to know ! It &apos;s bookmarked !
Really ! Why not ? I &apos;m very interested .
Oh yeah and did i forget to mention . How in the world do you get off saying I &apos;m a liar ? by the time im twenty two i will have accomplished so much more than you have . You pedegouge / scholars mistake being intellectual with blending in with everyone else . Try and stand out from the croud next time .
I see . Then what you are claiming is that creationists are the ones who should define the vocabulary to be used by evolutionary biologists . Would it then be ok for atheists to define the vocabulary of Christianity ?
So you refuse to engage in an informal debate on the topic , but you all of a sudden are itchin &apos; for a formal debate ? How about you make the challenge ?
Translation : we let you work and we let you vote , even though you let us down ( &apos; This is because of imperfection ... &apos; ) ; so even though &apos; men are not without blame too &apos; , the Fall is mainly your fault , so accept your inferior status and PIPE DOWN ! Now , any guesses as to what organs thinking _ person thinks with ? Clue : they &apos;re not above his waist .
&quot; Well I suppose I could &apos;ve always put up a sign that said &quot; &quot; Trespassers will be held with legal counsel , robbers will be shot , survivors will be shot again &quot; &quot; but you &apos;re just welcoming trouble with that . &quot;
And more people have died from anti-gun Senator Ted Kennedy &apos;s driving than will ever die from my AR-15 .
And oddly enough you have been given several on silver platters . Perhaps you need to visit a neurologist and get checked for memory problems ? Just to remind you once more - SICKLE CELL TRAIT is a mutation AND it benefits the phenotype under specific definable conditions . Do you really want to get hit about the head with that bat yet again ?
Oh No , everyone ! Our Mollusca has been undercut ! Whatever shall we do ?
Just a reminder , Belfrey : Don &apos;t hold your breath ...
If I ever see Arch defend a position at EvC I will eat my hat and the hat of my fiance , too .
You are like , so totally noble and sensitive ! I really admire your pro-humanity stance . That is going out on limb .
Less than a playstation , of course !
Is the little baby upset ? Too bad .
And I suppose they are also responsible for the evolution of utterly insane mental cases such as yourself ? And for electing GBII . And for Saddam Hussein . And for the drought in the South currently . And for cancer and AIDS . And heck why stop there why not for the Devil himself . All those sodomites must have become the original demons in hell I suppose .
&quot; Even the ones that are destined to go extinct without producing any &quot; &quot; daughter &quot; &quot; species ? Apeart from that quibble though , you are right . But don &apos;t tell the creationsts ; it &apos;ll only confuse them &quot;
So in other words your God put you on Earth to stop people from killing so your God could kill them eventually ?
Here &apos;s a novel idea - how about the right gives up the abstinence programmes ( scientifically unproven ) and improves access to and information on b / c to stop women having UPPs in the first place ? Just a thought .
&quot; How extraordinary that Catholic theologians understand the Old Testament better than the folks who wrote it because they &quot; &quot; have more books to understand that passage . &quot; &quot; Yeah , there has been a lot of Catholic blather written to obfuscate the Bible . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I dunno guys ... I think I &apos;ve been saved . * sings * &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been redeemed , by the blood of the lamb ... &quot; &quot; ummm ... barbequed lamb .... rare ... yumm .... I &apos;m wondering , Benjamin , if you would trade some photos of the Holy Pink Bunny for the shroud of Turin ? &quot;
Personally , I believe that god doesn &apos;t exist , and I have a link , too ! By the way , sorry for all the links , but I have found that since creationism has been so well refuted elsewhere , I don &apos;t have to do too much work . It also helps that I &apos;m presenting evidence , right ?
Or , given that this is about feasts , a waist is a terrible thing to mind .
Cars don &apos;t breed . Or didn &apos;t you know that ?
That is your belief . You &apos;ve no evidence provided other than it is just your belief .
And creationism was investigated and explored completely and shown to be false .
And yet you seem to feel we should leave these issues to the government , which has done nothing but corporate takeovers in regard to banks , automotive industries , and now health care .
&quot; I think this is pretty much common sense . I think some study is in order , though . Everybody .... put a sign in your window that says &quot; &quot; This is a gun free home &quot; &quot; and we will see if the incidents of robberies goes up among group memebers . &quot;
&quot; You know why . Because they want you to stop posting . Most of them want to rant , and they don &apos;t want their rants challanged . It &apos;s typical of the whole evolutionary community , I &apos;m afraid . Obvious _ child and I are exploring this up in the &quot; &quot; numbers &quot; &quot; thread . &quot;
Oh dear . Have you ever looked at a human spine ? It is curved : it &apos;s bent . A straight spine is a knackered spine . As to the hands bit , what are you on about ? You are aware I hope that the story that the nosey elephant got it &apos;s trunk because a crocodile grabbed the end and stretched it is just a story ?
No Christian sin ? ? ? Other then the intent to kill and then doing so
&quot; * * The &quot; &quot; methodology &quot; &quot; of science is not materialism / mechanism / darwinism , but simply empiricism leading inductively / abductively to hypotheses regarding regularities in causation in nature that can be tested via the predictive experimentation of the scientific method . Neither empiricism or the epistemological process of the scientific method are the exclusive property of materialism / mechanism , nor did they originate from within that metaphysic , despite the beliefs of materialist / mechanists to that effect . Unfortunately , some 150 years ago , that methodology was set aside , and has remained out of sight , with regard to the hypothesis that is generally referred to as &apos; darwinism &apos; . &quot;

&quot; I love this line . I assume by &quot; &quot; harm &quot; &quot; you mean an actual physical harm or some kind or another ( physical in this case includes loss of items ) . So this would cut our laws in half . Walk around naked ? No big deal ! Have sex on the street why doing cocaine ... go for it ! Drunk in public ? Who cares ! The list can go on forever . &quot;
Way to support your controversial assertion , Bell .
&quot; Maybe what they &apos;re saying is &quot; &quot; Grow some balls and practice civil disobedience by violating anti-Constitutional Laws that threaten your safety . &quot;
Milesian Race vs Anglo-Saxon race . They just happen to be Protestants and Catholics . Sorry , I should have known that would be over your head .
Actually he is , and he &apos;s posted on this thread . It is a pity that you &apos;re unwilling to debate , but endeavour a smear campaign as you did on the Science and Math posts . I would advise you read the above quote before talking again
Come back when you learn the difference between climate and weather .
You got THAT right ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
For bringing health care to women without the means ? For providing Pap Smears , Mammograms , and birth control for women without the means ? Providiing pre-natal , and post-natal care ? Oh , heck , let the women die of breast cancer and uterine cancer ! Why not ; bash Gays , then you bash the women .
&quot; You &apos;ve gotta love when ignorance lends itself to incredible mistakes like the above statement . &quot; &quot; Excepting &quot; &quot; that there is some magical sky man is precisely what atheists do . Looks like we have another Einstein who wants to test his opinions with people who actually know what they &apos;re talking about. lpdm , you &apos;d better learn quickly , or I don &apos;t think you &apos;ll like it here as much as you were hoping . &quot;
I don &apos;t know how this can be true . Thank God that I didn &apos;t grow up with my biological father . I &apos;m not really interested in being a jerk .
How tolerant . Lets talk about the Spanish Inquisition .
And they wonder why the science community doesn &apos;t take them seriously ...
Apparently you &apos;ve got one powerful set of rose colored glassed . I guess you spend a lot of money on those 1-900 psychics too . Nowhere is it scientifically inaccurate ? Are you serious ? Waxy

Ok ... many many people have been killed in Africa because of the policies of the countries in the EU , South America , Asia , and so on .... this hypocrisy annoys me .
No surprise there . You would have to invest some thought to define something . Why don &apos;t you just consult your Little Golden Dictionary ?
well that won &apos;t help you when you go to hell ... Woo hoo
Will the Obama administration come for your guns ?
What a trite statement .
&quot; How strange . It seems that Habbit &apos;s definition of the word definition is meaningless . Physicists and chemists can define what they mean by the word &quot; &quot; carbon , &quot; &quot; but according to Habbit that is just their opinion . According to Habbit , carbon can be a chocolate candy meant to be eaten in a car . That may be his opinion and he considers it as valid as specific definitions assigned to words used by experts in any given field . &quot;
/ hypothetical mode on . The State murders an innocent man . / hypothetical mode off .
I think the correct term is Priuseses
&quot; So , in summation , your position is that the US should be more like the Europeans ? Should we also bathe less frequently ? Have poor dental hygeine ? Become an &quot; &quot; also ran &quot; &quot; economy ? No thanks . I have no desire to mimic Europe . &quot;
But in terms of legality and constitutionality , do you believe that they should still be prohibited ? Also , how can god hate ? I thought he was true love . Scratch that-- I thought he was unknowable . Thanks
And in those 150 years , all the evolutionists in the world haven &apos;t been able to falsify or debunk the book of Genesis . Of course , in their own deluded minds , they actually believe they have done just that .
You jsut don &apos;t get it . You act like two wolves and a sheep voting on what to have for lunch . You as a hetero get to go and get married to the person of your choice but I do not . What part of that do you not understand . You say this isn &apos;t personal and for you this is true but for me the man I love is nothing but a stranger to me in the eyes of the law . How cruel can you be
So what are you trying to do here - smother everyone with bafflegab ?
&quot; Is there a defined number of posts he could make in the other threads so that you would consider them &quot; &quot; finished &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
Hey , thanks for the quote ! Am I published now ?
Well you never know cause your pro life and for the death penalty .
So what does this have to do with the topic ? Alcohol is legal , marijuana isn &apos;t , but they both serve the same purpose ( getting high ) , so why should one be illegal and the other not ?
Wrong . It was Soviet women . The USSR no longer exists . Unless you believe that those godless commies are just playing possum ?
Don &apos;t even think about contriving how gay marrige violates YOUR RIGHTS assmonkey . That &apos;s the most ludicrous , inane statement I have yet heard from the Religious Right .
Are we talking about the same Obama here ? The same one , who &apos;s head of the DHS , told law enforcement to be on the lookout for anyone who disagreed with the government ?
&quot; But don &apos;t you see ? They aren &apos;t sure . They don &apos;t know . They didn &apos;t &quot; &quot; prove &quot; &quot; anything ! ! &quot;
&quot; Wrong again sherlock . All of this animosity is after the fact to why radical islam considers our christian Nation to be hypocritical due to the exporting of our pop culture of hedonistic sexual and moral depravity . That was why they signed fatwas against us originally . It is the abortions , gay marriage and our women walking around half naked that caused that lack of respect to occur . And you can thank the immoral left for that contribution to Americas image . It was the Left that coined the phrase , &quot; &quot; If it feels good , do it , &quot; &quot; Not the Right . &quot;
Bingo . Old fossils can be corrupted ( contaminated , to be precise ) by contacting anything from human skin to pollen in the air . This would add a relatively large amount of carbon to the fossil and would indicate that the fossil is recent . It &apos;s not hard to imagine this happening in the hands of inexperienced scientists ... * cough * Creationists * cough *
So ... all Christians have some sort of brain damage , trebor ? You &apos;re not getting any better at this are you ?
And many of the questions that creationists ask .
The comment of someone with an IQ of about 48 . Ray M.
Gee , Jo , you really should have read your sources . There is one part in here about the French &apos; navy &apos; and Churchill you really should read
If a woman does not want to be pregnant , she can abstain from sex . It works !
Oh they think they can Doc ! They think that we gun owners are the terrorist ! Personally . I think that all of this talk about Gun Control is happening because they are mad . They are MAD that a Black Man ! Is in the White House !
And LIVING ones even more ... ok Adolph .
&quot; I &apos;d rather be &quot; &quot; offed &quot; &quot; than to live with a wild eyed screaming banshee like yourself setting policy and demanding impossible tasks . Are the police SOB &apos;S too ? I don &apos;t suppose you would object to the friendly neighborhood rapist getting shot by a gun owning neighbor now would you ? &quot;
And there we go again . Re-read the bit about dancing around the land mines , if you in fact did read it the first time .
Oh , just come right out and say it , women are subhuman , all they are is wombs . Come on , let &apos;s show the true colors of the pro-fetus movement .
Well , that &apos;s because all those things happened during the Age of Law ( the god of swift and harsh justice bit ) , whereas now we &apos;re in the Age of Grace ( the god is all-forgiving bit ) , so . . . . er . . . hang on a minute .
Well , both traffic in waste material . Many traps are present in each for them to function properly . And don &apos;t forget where biological evolution and plumbing both lead you--into a cesspool .
You &apos;re right it &apos;ll be fighting the war in Iraq . ) Nah , really it &apos;ll be from social security , etc etc .
And I wasn &apos;t asked if I wanted my federal tax dollars to go towards hetero benefits and to support their walking sperm .
So SS . Please explain it all to me . Please show that you are not conclusion jumping and making unwarranted extrapolation based on poor understanding of the material . In other words , show me that you understand by explaining the research to me . Thanks .
Stop telling me to look at the big picture when you &apos;ve had both of your eyes gouged out ! Your entire statement here is beyond stupid . If the criminals felt that the only time to be armed was when their intended victims could fight back , then the criminals in DC would never be armed and the police wouldn &apos;t have needed to introduce gun shot sensors in the city . But since DC was the murder capital of the United States , that says an absence of hard targets isn &apos;t a guarantee that the abusers will play fair and not use weapons .
Because all scientists hate god , this is a fact .
Your god is also the god of deceit . Why else would he erase all evidence of such a flood ? Why erase the bones from the animals that must have died as the emigrated from the arks resting place ? Answer those two and I &apos;ll have lots more
Well Im not hunting animals
&quot; Oh they are ? Thats strange ... I could not find where exactly they stand on any of thier numerous websites , just more restrictions ... And the old HCI was not &quot; &quot; moderate &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; You see , that &apos;s the problem : &quot; &quot; generally &quot; &quot; . You obviously know little or nothing of how prejudice works in this country . &quot;
So you don &apos;t believe that life had an origin ! WOW so you think its always been present on the Earth ? Not even the bible goes that far ! And you fail to account for the observation that there IS life .
Talking about traitors , brady you are IT . Meanwhile on the other board you started previous to cutting and running like the coward you obviously are , Bryan posted a challenge to you . If you choose to accept the challenge which I have money that you do not accept , ( so don &apos;t dissapoint me ) , be sure to read his guidelines so you will not make strawman arguments and red herring arguments . I am betting you cannot carry on a sustained debate without falling flat on your face
&quot; Yeah , I should , then we could have a more intelligent converstation You understand that in the Plaxico Burris case , the &quot; &quot; authorities &quot; &quot; did just exactly that , found ammo of a different caliber and assumed he had those guns too . Article today on that at RKBA . Of course , you would probably be more interested in this : Texas jury jails man 35 years for marijuana possession &#124; Raw Story At first I thought maybe you had come to see old Doc and got waylaid on the way . Nice to see you posting whatever ! &quot;
So , in order to be against gay marriage , a person has to be faithful in his own marriage ? Gimme a break . He supports what his constituents want him to support or he doesn &apos;t get elected . In case you haven &apos;t noticed , the majority of Americans are against gay marriage .
&quot; Well maybe that will teach him to get a education for once . Still , my analogy is quite true . Furthermore both words are meant by creationists to argue evolution is faith . Dishonest , but that is essentialy the mantra of creationism . &quot; &quot; Lie , cheat , steal and fabricate to get people to be believe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it is hilarious that you still think that in order to do a detailed study of evolution , you have to read 10 different books on it and take brainwashing classes from a university . Maybe you just like making yourself feel superior to me ... who knows ...
&quot; You are SO insulting . &quot; &quot; Oh , the poor dears have been through too much and are considering an action I disagree with so they must not be thinking clearly . &quot; &quot; Who are you to say they aren &apos;t thinking clearly ? I &apos;ll give it to you , Bassman . You are the most polite , best veiled misogynist I have ever encountered . You nearly had me fooled . &quot;
Chalk it up to the fact that -- although not all the time -- a good part of the time , the same people are pretty anti-anything education . We shouldn &apos;t expect them to argue positions that make sense .
yes , we will send you to the camps and all of us will gather in our black robes and dance around a fire while we make you dig ditches .
Well , then , I guess that in America we can &apos;t possibly be safe from kill-happy gunners can we ?
Oh yeah right , like sociopaths who are bent on killing and slaughtering everyone around them , can be fixed with something as stupid as school counseling .
&quot; Really ? Then why did you start off your little rant by admitting that &quot; &quot; ... microevolution cannot be reasonably disputed . &quot; &quot; Evolution has been observed , and that is a fact . Speciation in both plants and animals has been observed , and that is a fact . Apparently you don &apos;t know what a theory is . Might it not be wise to learn just a little about science before you make yourself look so foolish ? Theories explain facts . &quot;
Well then who do I have to call ? I &apos;d like to report Brady for being in possession of 13,000 rounds of restricted armor piercing ammunition and 100 guns , most of which have been illegally modified for full-auto firing capabilities , as well as an uncounted number of IEDs . The link doesn &apos;t work , BTW .
&quot; What quaint illogic . Only people who marry can get divorced , so a reduction in people marrying has no effect on rising divorce rates . If anything , a rising divorce rate among fewer marriages points to an even higher divorce rate than &quot; &quot; normal &quot; &quot; . &quot;
Since I don &apos;t believe believe that everything had a common ancestor , a rock , I consider all ancient reptiles dinosaurs . If that is incorrect in your book so be it . We are not debating the definition of dinosaurs .
&quot; Oh look , a lie . Imagine my surprise . Truth : Scientists have extrapolated that the universe expanded from an incredibly dense mass . The Big Bang theory does not posit that this mass &quot; &quot; popped &quot; &quot; into existence ; in fact , we have no idea what happened less than 10 ^ -43 seconds after expansion began . It is a common interpretation that there was no time &quot; &quot; before &quot; &quot; the mass existed , therefore the first law of thermodynamics was not violated . &quot;
No , you &apos;re the NRA &apos;s wet dream .
Jesus was a retarded ancient hippie who walked passed people who were starving and dying , yet didn &apos;t help them . Jesus is a man who ignored his family and considered his disciples family instead . Jesus is a man who didn &apos;t come to preach peace , but use a sword . Jesus is a man who didn &apos;t repudiate much of the Old Testament atrocities . Jesus is bad , and Jesus is GOd , therefore God is bad . I don &apos;t care what the biblical stoner said .
Well as long as you ignore the evidence , why do you need proof . Blind faith works just fine .
Almighty nature ? You mean you believe in the universe ? Welceom to the club . I think we can all agree we &apos;re part of the universe . Except for skeptics , they delude themsleves into thinking they cannot know ( which they claim to know ) . -Mach
I note that you consider yourself irrational , though I could not possibly comment . There are times that I am grateful that your parents chose to live on the wrong side of the Atlantic , but then I allow for your need to identify with your adopted home and reject the motherland . You flatter yourself in assuming that you were any part of my considerations when choosing to post . The button reference is a play on words known as a pun .
Really ? I haven &apos;t seen you post your support for any law or proposal that would punish criminals in the most severe ways possible . All I &apos;ve ever seen you post support for is more laws that criminalize things that aren &apos;t crimes and do nothing to harm others .
I see . Sounds too nebulous to stand up to scrutiny in the US . I &apos;m guessing that the SCOTUS would strike down such as law as being too vague .
I &apos;d be pretty dumb to buy something from someone who doesn &apos;t even believe in what they &apos;re selling . Those teachers may teach it , but they don &apos;t believe in it .
&quot; which is pretty much the same thing . The majority of representatives get their way . The representatives are elected by a majority . Being overally picky about it gets you no where ... we pretty much have a majority rules nation . And we still haven &apos;t settled the question about how you think you can impose your belief on others but I can &apos;t . The &quot; &quot; convention &quot; &quot; idea didn &apos;t work , the idea that you aren &apos;t imposing a belief on others didn &apos;t work , so what is next ? &quot;
Atheism is for cynical , self-righteous twits
Well feel free to disprove evolution anytime .
But you are the accuser . I &apos;ve read the Bible and I have studied religion , more than you can imagine . I have also studied biology , performed experiments and reached conclusions . The problem is that you seem unable to think for yourself .
You know what is far worse than not executing murderers ? Letting &apos; em sit around , watch tv , and eat pizza . ; \ LEVIATHAN
Do you have a fire extinguisher in your house ? I have never had a fire in my kitchen but I still keep a fire extinguisher in there . I look at wearing firearms for self defense the same way I look at wearing a seat belt . I wear it and pray I &apos;ll never need it , but I &apos;ll be damn glad I &apos;m wearing it if I do need it . God Bless
As far as I &apos;m aware your aim is for abortion not to happen , my point is that despite making it illegal it will still happen -- making it illegal is not achieving your aim . Hence my point is sound , and as such it is a good point .
So all jellyfish die on the beach ? Hardly . Let &apos;s use this same type of logic though . A jellyfish is pretty fragile , as you pointed out . Wouldn &apos;t a jellyfish that was very rapidly covered in sediment be broken into many pieces , if not ground to a paste ? Wouldn &apos;t this entirely rule out the possibilty of preservation in this manner ?
So in your own words the police want to go on murder sprees , because they &apos;re armed . According to you the military is just waiting for the first convenient excuse to open fire on anyone , be them designated enemies or just innocent bystanders .
Oh , but Sina does not live in a womb so she is unimportant .
&quot; Oh , his brain wasn &apos;t there , huh ? Musta just been involuntary reflexes that allowed him walk from a store to the &quot; &quot; home &quot; &quot; that he stayed at . Oh , and please show me some cases of foetuses walking to the store like this man did when he was attacked , and then we can start comparing . Looks like VT is back with his usual strawmen and sensationalism . &quot;
What &apos;s your definition of pure ?
Actually , breeding horses and donkeys isn &apos;t an effort to create a new species . Where did you get such a thoughtless idea . And neither is interbreeding lions and tigers . However , you don &apos;t seem to be aware that neither ligers or tigons are sterile . They are capable of breeding with each other or with either of the parent species . And then there are polar bears and brown bears , which can and will interbreed if given the opportunity . And the offspring are perfectly fertile .
So being easy to know makes it good ? methinks that &apos;s not quite right .
So atheists are capable of goodness , love , kindness , generosity and sympathy but they have no meaning unless one conforms the the fundamentalist christian morality .
Neener neener - is it time to go in from the playground yet ?
You are , in effect , telling me that putting someone in a position that will inevitable leave them dead does not make you responsible for their death . If I fire a bullet at your head , while that bullet is in mid-air , I am no longer doing anything to hurt you , and you are fine . However , I have set in motion affects that will result in your demise . This makes me responsible for your death .
&quot; Maybe they just drink too much coffee . And you probably work with more &quot; &quot; reefer heads &quot; &quot; than you think . &quot;
So you dont know ?
Props for what ? Refusing to read your middle school biology textbook ?
Oh gosh , a whole bunch of cut / pastes from a 14 year old that is showing off their lack of knowledge . These are not unknown situations , and are very easily explained .
Yes , amazing , how they weren &apos;t people before .
Now you are being insulting . Evolution makes no statments about your god . For that matter , neither does cosmology , astronomy , chemistry , physics or geology .
So will they be in front of or behind a leaf ?
Well I don &apos;t know about you guys , but I was baptized so I &apos;m out of that eternal damnation thing .
&quot; That &quot; &quot; somebody &quot; &quot; was a Jesuit priest , the idea met some initial resistance because of it &apos;s religious overtones . But the overwhelming evidence in favor of it carried the day . You should study some history too . &quot;
Well , you &apos;re writing from an embryo &apos;s point of view , when an embryo doesn &apos;t even have a point of view . It would be like writing from a rock &apos;s point of view .
Abstinance ? ! Heaven forbid .
Nor is there any need for some mythical molecular elemental , nebulas natural selection , or mystical transitionals based on peicemeal forensics and antithestic rhetoric .
And you are only trying to earn yourself brownie points in hell .
Really ? From what university did you earn your science degree that makes you qualified to make judgements about what is science ?
Well nobody has turned up the Ark have they , termites could assure that if properly used . After 40 days and more they would be ravenous .
While it may be true that an ovum is formed during the mother &apos;s fetal stage , an ovum is not a unique human entity in and of itself . It does not become a unique human entity until it is fertilized at conception . ( Do you like semantics games ? )
&quot; * * I &quot; &quot; pretend &quot; &quot; to nothing . I am not &quot; &quot; pretending &quot; &quot; to beilieve you to be a materialit / darwinist . I do believe exactly that . And as for your threat to make my arguments look silly , I &apos;m not shaking in my boots . I &apos;ve made your arguments look presumptuous , pretentious and silly , but you have never yet succeeded in doing that to any of mine . &quot;
God talk about a bunch of foo foo poop ! What are you a girl ? Any way honey , dont you think that net result was a lot of people who for one reason or another could not resist there biological programming will get AIDS because they were told not to have sex in place of getting condoms ? I cant believe I had to explain that to you .
Innocent life ? We have had some interesting debates here where Christians have yielded to evidence that the state executes innocents yet they still support the death penality . As I recall , the woman who committed adultry was guilty and subject to death under the law ( of Moses ) yet Christ said one without sin should throw the stone . Are Christians that support the death penality without sin ? In-house debate ? Whose house ? Dono
Don &apos;t like it when the person you &apos;re arguing against can be as sarcastic as you are , huh ? I understand , I get these types of whines all the time. thistownwilleat-
&quot; Oh , well when you put it that way .... Maybe you could address this one thing . &quot; &quot; The total elimination of arms from society . &quot; &quot; You &apos;d think someone from Brady might have said this somewhere , sometime , that you could compare to the memo . I would . &quot;
Could it partially be the fact that they don &apos;t want antiquated belief system dogma making their decisions ? Must have access to a sonogram sounds like a lobby group attempting to sway opinion while enhancing revenue . Does the legislation force pregnant women who have not chosen abortion to have a sonogram ? Raising children creates post-delivery stress syndrome .
&quot; end where ? ambiguously phrased. if &quot; &quot; here &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; , then yes ! by definition , yes ! &quot;
So long as they do not contain my DNA , yes .
Oh dear , deluded philisopher nutter alert . No one can empirically prove anything . Fact . End of discussion .
So which came first ? The liquor or the egg ?
But they consider the exact same thing inside a human that has yet to be implanted a pregnancy ? Double standards much ?
No I can &apos;t marry them becasue some of them are married . Also none have intent to li ve within Mass .
Nor does the fact that he was a Christian prove all Christianity is wrong .
Oh well thats tough hat to victims of rape then . Somehow I doubt this will survive legal challenges , assuming Gov.Rounds actually signs the Bill .
Six people out of , at the very least one million , at the very most five million . Are you really gonna prosecute one million plus people based on the actions of six individuals ? Are you expecting a 1,000 % perfection standard from gun owners ? How many catholic priests have molested little children ? Should we hold them all responsible ? How many gun control supporters also support the killing of unborn children ? Or better yet , how many game animals have died of starvation and disease , because gun control supporters lobbied against hunting seasons ?
All forms of life ? Animal life ? Plant life ? The mold growing in your bathroom ?
Reasonable gun regulation is an oxymoron like military intelligence . You mean like Bill Ayers ( sic ) and his wife or Carl Rowen ? Wait my bad they aren &apos;t from the right .
&quot; Does this seem a little ironic to anyone else ? Either becoming intoxicated is acceptable or it isn &apos;t , why does the method make one acceptable and practitioners of the other &quot; &quot; losers &quot; &quot; ? For the record I don &apos;t drink , smoke or partake of illegal drugs . &quot;
&quot; Since when ? So if I were to post a news article where someone says that pedophilia should be legalized , then it means I agree with them ? I thought this was a discussion board . That means we , you know , DISCUSS THINGS . Now , if I had said &quot; &quot; Here is AiG &apos;s article and I couldn &apos;t agree with them more &quot; &quot; , then you would have an argument . As I did not , you don &apos;t . Now , do you retract your false statement that what you quoted was my reasoning ? &quot;
So you support allowing a 10 y / o to buy an Uzi and carry it into a federal court house or school as long as he does not commit a crime ? Wow . And your logic about taking criminals off the street and then having no gun control concerns would be perfect ... if we had a finite number of criminals . We don &apos;t . New murderers and theives and carjackers and dope dealers and bank robbers and child rapists are born every day .
So taking away all their guns would have been better ? The ruling party was certainly well armed how about the other parties ?
Just to add more fuel on the fire : P
So , which is it ? You don &apos;t want violators of Federal law to have guns , yet you don &apos;t want them to get rid of them either . Can &apos;t possibly do both , now can you ? Which one ? Do the law breakers keep them , or not ? Make it against the law to keep the guns ... now make it against the law to sell them . DUH ! I guess we &apos;ll just hang out in limbo-land !
And I suspect WW understands it about as well as you do ...
&quot; You think its bad now ? Watch what happens if Gov &apos;t takes control . I saw a great tagline the other day , it said &quot; &quot; If the US get socialized medicine where will Canadians get healthcare ? &quot; &quot; Anyone who doesn &apos;t like insurance premiums is free not to pay them , at least until the gov &apos;t takes over . Happy New Year &quot;
not bad for a procedure that doesn &apos;t exist .
Should all drivers have to help pay for harm done by irresponsible drivers ?
Many of the Christian denominations are ignoring them the same way they ignore the prohibitions against pork , mixed cloth , and stoning your children to death because they sass you .
Yeah , a license to murder the unborn ...........
Really ? I have not seen one coherent idea from both of them combined .
You know something is wrong with this world when people attack the act of posting an opinion ( that of Ms. King ) and another condemns the idea that someone may read it and develop their own opinion . Saving lives is not just a Republican goal . And yes it is an act of desperation . All acts are an act of desperation when it comes to saving the natural process of life with out interference of those who place their comfort above the life inside them . Whatever is wrong outside the womb , is not the fault of the inhabitant within the womb .
You mean Priests ? Because I hear the ladies are crawling all over them , can &apos;t get enough of that catholic loving ...
And the moon could fall from the sky , too .
You need to experiment with the notion that you will be sexually attracted to your own sex . After you &apos;re done , come back and report your findings !
Which wouldn &apos;t make a darn bit of difference - apart from the tiny matter of women dying and suffering permanent harm , but don &apos;t let that bother you. you &apos;ll also have to amend the constitution to remove any references to bodily autonomy. get ready to donate your kidney !
&quot; Answers include but are not limited to : • People need a solution for the Problem of Evil . • People want to have an &quot; &quot; objective &quot; &quot; standard for good and evil . • God said it , I believe it , that settles it . &quot;
&quot; So it would be more loving to severely beat the child ... forever ? &quot; &quot; Hey Timmy , remember when you were 3 and you wrote on the wall with that crayon ? * BAM * * SMACK * &quot; &quot; &quot;
And why not ? After all , Grimm &apos;s Fairy Tales is a wonderful read and who can deny the happiness Santa brings to 2nd graders ? What &apos;s a bit more fantasy gonna hurt ?
I &apos;m now slightly less confused about why I &apos;ve never seen this discussed before .
You think it was Me ? You are yet again , confused . I don &apos;t even know what a DROS is . Department of Registration Ohio State ? That would be my best guess , seeing that I am from Ohio !
I think that Comrade Brian is pulling our collective legs by pretending to be a die-hard , uninformed , living-in-denial communist , when in fact he &apos;s a just another guy trying to have a laugh by trolling the boards . I truly find it hard to believe that anyone could be so completely uninformed about capitalism and socialism .
And yet it &apos;s usually the liberal democrats who are in favor of murdering innocent children ...
&quot; Of course , when wabbit says &quot; &quot; dishonesty , &quot; &quot; he means &quot; &quot; oversimplification &quot; &quot; ; the NMSR webpage is clearly designed for the layperson , not the geneticist . When he says &quot; &quot; scientist , &quot; &quot; he means &quot; &quot; shameless hack . &quot; &quot; Spetner argued that this is not an example of an increase in information until he had it repeatedly and undeniably shown to meet Spetner &apos;s own definition of information . Only now has he said , &quot; &quot; Okay , so it &apos;s an increase , therefore it &apos;s not random . &quot; &quot; Classic moving the goalposts syndrome . But if wabbit would like to continue leaning on Spetner as a &quot; &quot; reliable source , &quot; &quot; I won &apos;t stop him . More fun for me . &quot;
So where will you be moving to ?
So you yourself could have gone gay but chose to be attracted to women ?
In the case of Demorats and liberals ; it is monkey see , monkey do .
Well what do you expect ? ! Everytime gun owners try and do anything to combat crime , you liberal sissies yell and scream about vigilantism and foam at the mouth as you talk about how we &apos;re taking the law into our own hands and that we &apos;ll be administering death sentences without trials for matters as trivial as jaywalking ! You want us to combat crime , but you don &apos;t want us to actually do anything . Make up your mind already !
Only if she &apos;s piloting at the same time .
Just another example of using a verse meant for personal use and applying it to wars . Sorry , just doesn &apos;t work that way .
&quot; yeah ok buddy . Just because you can not figure out what those little numbers on the end of the things I have posted nor simply because you lack the mental fortitude to look back to some of my older posts or click and R * E * A * D the links to see that I have indeed provided ample backing does not mean that I haven &apos;t been doing MY job . Now do you have anything of substance to add &quot; &quot; Tim &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; Futue te et ipsum caballum tuum &quot; &quot; &quot;
why are you afraid of guns ? has one jumped up and shot at you ? you should never fear a gun , respect the gun .
It was a pretty clear rebuttle of the idea that the ToE breeds social elitism , Marxism , and Nazisim . I guess you &apos;re right though , SS . This wasn &apos;t nearly as entertaining as a slough of out-of-context quotes to show that ToE-accepting biologists reject the ToE .
Most of the laws of the Peoples Republic of Kalifornia are aimed at rendering the citizens into prey . You can &apos;t point to many that don &apos;t . Self defense is not allowed there I am afraid .
Abstinence until you are old enough to handle sexual relationships responsibly should most certainly be preached along with information about and access to birth control . There are plenty of us who have no interest in the institution of marriage - your religion should not determine who amongst is a sexually active adult . Not to mention we have got to stop pushing the gotta get married have a partner to be a happy seccuesful person message - ESPECIALLY TO GIRLS - it will lead to sex , for heaven forbid they be SINGLE .
&quot; Really ? Funny , my son , even before I &quot; &quot; came out &quot; &quot; didn &apos;t think gays were bad or being gay was bad . He saw hate as being the real evil ... and you exemplify that just perfectly ... brava ! &quot;
8 . Gay marriage will encourage people to be gay , in the same way that hanging around tall people will make you tall . This may be true because you cant chance your height ... but let me tell you ... hanging around jack asses will make you a jack XXX
My my , did someone get up on the wrong side of the bed or what , of course you realize that you just gave me the answer I was looking for , not that I didnt already know the answer , I just wanted you to say it . I dont believe I need a clue , so I will let you have it instead Brady .
And lets not neglect the fact that he was tetotal and a vegetarian to boot . Well , looky here we all learnt today that bad people can have have good characteristics ............ Sounds like Pastor Russell Johnson &apos;s representation of truth is as selective as it is self serving .
And the Violence Policy Center is somehow more trustworthy ?
&quot; So what &apos;s your solution , keep all blacks unarmed so the bad blacks can &apos;t hurt the good blacks ? I guess you &apos;ve decided to drop your argument that the Second Amendment was a racist tool designed to keep blacks &quot; &quot; in their place &quot; &quot; under the thumb of their masters . &quot;
How do you know if they WANT to believe in a deity ? They simply don &apos;t .
Which demonstrates your failure to see the big picture .
So , why don &apos;t you give it a try ? ? ?
So now you want to demonstrate that you are also ignorant of the fossil record ?
Who but a creationist would ever make such a laughable claim ?
I think this post pretty much sums up the depths of your prejudice , and the thoroughness of your ignorance . A child should endure physical abuse before being allowed to be adopted by a loving gay couple ? Being abused physically is preferential to being adopted by a loving gay couple ? I always have to chuckle when people are so eager to reveal their prejudices in such a way that demonstrates they are completely non-credible as any type of character witness ...
Any proof that he was a murderous sociopath ? It &apos;s your assertion ... I can &apos;t help but feel you &apos;re grasping at straws .
Its better then being dead .............
So you actually know enough , you can see the beginning and end of time , you know what is inside each and every individual on the planet so much so that you can say God is wrong to do any given act ? How is this possible oh great and mighty oz ?
&quot; Yep it is easy . Lizards didn &apos;t evolve an avian lung . This should be easy for the creationist : The avian lung is far more efficient than the mammalian lung . Why didn &apos;t your god therefore fit the superior lung design to mammals , especially that apparent &quot; &quot; special creation &quot; &quot; , us humans ? Also please explain why he fitted a superior eye design to squid and octupuses than what he fitted to all vertibrates . Once you have answered these two easy questions , I &apos;ve a few hundred more for you &quot;
Oh , I get it … Flashlights and I-Pods have souls and consciousness .
&quot; Once cannot abort a pregnancy if it has not begun . The morning after pill prevents a pregnancy from ever occuring by preventing the fertilized egg from implanting . If one considers pregnancy to begin at conception ( i.e. fertilization of the egg ) , then petri dishes are pregnant when eggs are fertilized on them ( &quot; &quot; conception &quot; &quot; ) for later IVF . Do we really want to be considering petri dishes pregnant ? &quot;
So it &apos;s alright for a Evo to insult you and go off on a tangent , and expect to get answer . What &apos;s the point in answering if your being mocked , before you give answer . Now I know why there are few Creo &apos;s on this forum .
Yes , have you ?
I still haven &apos;t heard an answer to this yet ?
So , one set of creationists are XXXXXX , but the others are not ?
So you think that , if murders were legal , there would still be the same number ? How about robberies , or rapes ? There are plenty of those , the law can &apos;t be having any effect ... In short , I &apos;m saying that making anything illegal reduces that thing . Criminalising murder results in less murder , criminalising drugs leads to reduced supply of drugs ( compare any drug with nicotine , or alcohol ) , and criminalising guns would lead to a similar reduction .
Actually when you read every thing you have to rationalize ( lie ) what God actually did , for God was done with everything then started again . THe stories don &apos;t parallel each other they intersect .
If science deals with how information is gathered , different ways of analyzing , and different hypothesis , then it involves worldviews . The base for the worldview of a sizable part of the population should not be excluded . Maybe in Saddam Hussien &apos;s Iraq , maybe in communist Russia , but not in the United States .
&quot; And of course , the sea of Montalban &apos;s assertions as science , the sea of Montalban &apos;s out of context quotes , or the sea of Montalban &apos;s misrepresentations of what others have said . It seems that Montalban knows the &quot; &quot; TROOTH &quot; &quot; and won &apos;t be discouraged with facts . Sadly , Montalban knows what he believes and reality seems to be irrelevant . &quot;
So the fact that it is not legally recognized is the problem . What is the reason it &apos;s not legally recognized ? Because the couple is gay .
Bertvan : Does this self-organization force “ whip up ” complex features intelligently and purposefully ? Or does it “ whip them up ” by some unknown deterministic process in which creativity is somehow achieved by accident ?
You know , from the title , I was sure this would be about The hitchhikers guede to the galaxy &apos; bible fish ...
So , you &apos;re just an anti-geologist , anti-cosmologist , anti-archaeologist , anti-physicist , and probably a few more that I can &apos;t be arsed to think of right now . * shrugs * Might as well get it over with and just say you &apos;re an anti-science religious nutter .
Give me three good reasons why a thirteen year old girl from Plam Beach , that are practial not religous please , should not have an abortion and I will promise not to make fun of you . Much . Judges do this everyday . This case just made the news .
No , back to school ... turn in what educational credntials you feel you have , and just stay at the coffeehouses ... at least you have a .005 % of hearing someone ineject some truth in one of those sidewalk tete a &apos; tete &apos;s you nutters are so fond of ... but here you are dead wrong . Have you ever heard of an egg ? ever heard of a sperm ? An egg is still considered a multiple cell organism , and a sperm as well . You &apos;re gonna have a hard time pulling that one off .
&quot; i think slave holder &apos;s asked a similar question to people who believed slavery was wrong . &quot; &quot; what are they worth anyways ? ? why do they deserve to be treated like us ? &quot; &quot; hmm &quot;
&quot; lol ... you read my whole post only to conclude with &quot; &quot; what &apos;s your point . &quot; &quot; Evolutionist brilliance on display . I &apos;m not mistaking nothing for nothing . I know my stuff . You obviously know nothing and don &apos;t care to learn it . &quot;
It has a financial impact on ALL taxpayers . To say that it has no impact on anyone else is disengenuous . Wow ! You can read Wiki &apos;s pseudo-knowledge . I &apos;m impressed ! Now , tell me how the court can rule a California Constitutional Amendment to be unconstitutional before it strikes down the Federal Law that gives states the FEDERAL right to ignore other state &apos;s gay marriages .
If you dont believe that muslims love life they will cut your head right off ! Its an easy choice if you ask me .
I think if that happened , Texas probably will go back to being the lone star state .
Methinks that our friend supersport has been reading too much of the Animorphs book series ( which was very popular among my two children ) - I wouldn &apos;t put it past him to try to use something like that to produce the case .
Sometimes ? The state of the public education system in the US is downright criminally neglectful .
And don &apos;t forget the part that we &apos;re all hot for her , too .
Showing the RIDICULOUS nature of some gun laws ! Even the Antis can &apos;t ( or maybe won &apos;t ) obey them ! Ridiculous paperwork traps that even caught and surprised the Queen of gun control ! If they had arrested her , they would have gotten a Real criminal off the streets and NOW our society would have finally been safe ! Ridiculous ! But it was a good thing for her , that Bloomburg and his Illegal Mayors weren &apos;t around when she broke America &apos;s gun laws !
If our guns are mearly popguns as you just described them , then why do you want to take them from us so badly . Maybe you are considering a life of crime as a carrer , and your afraid of being shot , is that whats really going on here .
But you debate with it ?
No , I &apos;m your regional manager .
Probably because buildings aren &apos;t biological or reproductive .
Just like it &apos;s the job of the gun control lobby to try and pass an overwhelming , unreasonable level of fear of an inanimate object ?
So what you &apos;re saying is that by mentioning both in the same post , I &apos;m saying that unless someone is a YEC then they aren &apos;t a christian ? Because that is what you attributed to me . Yet you have yet to post evidence of me saying that to anyone . Nor have you supported your original claim here , you said this : Last I checked , no credible fossil fuel firm hired YEC geologists . Prove this assertion since you researched it thoroughly enough to start a thread about .
&quot; The guys who want guns in their homes to protect themselves from burglars or &quot; &quot; just in case we need to pull off another revolution &quot; &quot; call others full of fear and mistrust ? &quot;
&quot; You mean like allowing for , and funding , comprehensive sex education , birth control , and parenthood planning ? Those things alone would reduce the number of abortions significantly . However , we live in a nation that would fire a Surgeon General for stating that masturbation is healthy . We live in a nation that believes that sex is only of the penis-vaginal penetration variety . We live in a nation where most pregnancy are unplanned . We &apos;re so busy &quot; &quot; protecting &apos; our children , that we don &apos;t realize that the best protection is information . &quot;
So , if a baby is having trouble breathing that &apos;s been born already , you don &apos;t consider it a &apos; person &apos; ? Methinks you &apos;ve not thought through the implications of your argument here at all .
&quot; No , they don &apos;t . Creationists do . &quot; &quot; Why haven &apos;t all animals turned into humans ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
Because those who are pro life are against a womens right to own her own body . Her body her choice and none of anyone elses business . Remember control freaks are everywhere .
You mean the truth of thousands of young teen girls dead with a coat hanger in hand ? Abortion is a neccessity so that it can be regulated . People will have abortions legal or not legal . At least provide a safety net other than a coat hanger .
So what ? They aren &apos;t worth anything , are they ? Does it matter if we kill them ? No , in your reasoning it doesn &apos;t because there are no absolutes .
oh , sure ... ok ... whatever you say .
Like the crazy idea the Earth goes around the Sun .
Because all scientists hate god . Again , this is a fact .
I don &apos;t give a damn about the circumstances of the unborn either ( obvious here I am not saying I don &apos;t care what happens to either , but for the sake of whether or not we should kill the unborn this is my stance ) . Neither one should have a right to kill the other ... and for that matter , no one else should be allowed to come up and murder the women or the unborn . So my views are still treating them as equals. and I will ask you to stay away from more assumtions that you can &apos;t prove .
And thus the human condition is explained at last !
&quot; I believe Alan Keyes already have used that term on us . ( Alan Keyes , the ultra-concervative Republican Candidate for the Illinois Senate seat - in opposition to Barack Obama . The Maryland resident the Republican party had to recruit because they couldn &apos;t find anyone else in their right mind who would go against Barack . Also the very same Maryland resident / Television talkshow host who beratted Hilary Clinton for moving to NY and expecting to be able to &quot; &quot; represent &quot; &quot; NY &apos;ers . Yeah , look who &apos;s the hypocrit now . ) &quot;
Oh God no . If there is anything more boring than twits talking , its twits
Amen ! ! Punish the whore ! If she would have just had the kid she would discover what we all know ... That the child would have been loved and protected given a nurturing home by her because she isn &apos;t really smart enough to know what she wants . She MUST have the kid , when it arrives all will be well ! ! We just know it !
so watching TV sports = bad daddy ? do you let your boyfriend / girlfriend or husband watch TV sports or only feminist approved TV channels ?
So , then you DO feel that what you did was a sin . Otherwise you wouldn &apos;t have asked forgiveness for it . I have one question . What was your motivation for starting this thread ? Was it to try and somehow prove that a person can be a Christian and have an abortion ? Just curious . IMO , you are right that you are forgiven for it , as God is a forgiving and loving God . But I hope you don &apos;t do it again .
Well then . All of the ex-christians have it both ways don &apos;t they . Since they are saved they can lie , cheat , steal and have wild , illicit sex ( following the example of several christian preachers ) .
Well , actually , I did find it funny even though I &apos;m a male ( or at least , I think I am ? ) ... probably because it &apos;s a joke and I know I &apos;m not like the stereo-typical male so I can laugh at them . PS , I &apos;m so unique because I &apos;m so humble and would never brag about my bulging muscles , manhood and amazing intellect .
Edmund , you still haven &apos;t come out of that wardrobe .
Chastity rather than promiscuity .
&quot; So you &apos;re saying that God is a &quot; &quot; respector &quot; &quot; ? -of-persons - iow , the mom &apos;s &quot; &quot; more &quot; &quot; -important to * God * ? than the unborn . &quot;
Well , it does take some scientific knowledge to understand the evidence for evolution . One doesn &apos;t expect Creationists to possess it .
Oh what a corageous maverick you are .
Oh what a shame ! Especially if it &apos;s true ! Where did you get the idea that ID theory is not based on evidence and / or testing ?
&quot; And you have just described &quot; &quot; creation science . &quot; &quot; No application of the scientific method . No testing . The conclusions are known before the judicious quoting of scientific authority has even begun . I notice that you use one of those quotes of a scientific authority below . You show that you are what you decry . &quot;
&quot; There is no god that supports the forcing of women to suffer and carry out unplanned pregnancies , just because some PL advocate spits it our . &quot; &quot; Sorry , were going to force you to give birth , those men over there have decided &quot; &quot; . Thats as ridiculous as saying &quot; &quot; There is no god to condones the slaughter of thousands of innocent life forms inside of the cut &quot; &quot; ( referring to disinfecting a cut ) . Pro-lifers have been dropped on their head too many times . &quot;
And you don &apos;t actually see the circulariey in your position ? The Bible is inspired by god because the Bible says that it is inspired by god . What if I wrote a book in which I declared that the book was inspired by god ? Good for you ? I &apos;ll do it if you give me the word . And what about the Book of Mormon ? Takes your book and goes one better . Also inspired by god because it says that it is inspired by god .
&quot; You know , I &apos;d believe that more if there were people like the Shindler family who have pushed for federal courts to intervene and destroy the sanctity of marriage . There is nothing you could do or say that would convince me that Americans somehow have any respect for marriage whatsoever . What heterosexuals have done to destroy this institution from the inside out only tells me that heteros are simply spoiled children who have the attitude of : &quot; &quot; If we can &apos;t make it work , we aren &apos;t going to allow anyone else to come in and do marriage better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
So ? God also says he made you out of dirt and then supernaturally lifting the dirt from the ground into the woman &apos;s uterus . Oh well , I suppose it is all beliefs no matter how silly it sounds .
Actually , that honour is reserved for the usual representations of those who advocate young earth creationism .
You repeat that like it actually means something ! Could it that your side is paranoid looking for some vast Right Winged conspiracy ? Maybe it &apos;s Bush &apos;s fault !
So you agree that it &apos;s not necessary to have high capacity magazines because gun owners can reload quickly when defending themselves against a criminals . Good we can agree on at least one thing .
Let me see if I have this right , Priscilla . You admit your ignorance of the topic and you refuse to read the linked article in order to learn the topic of the thread , and yet you are willing to offer an opinion . As Mr. Jack said , interesting .
as in anyone can purchase a fire arm without a background check or gun safety training ? not a good option. my apology if that was a failed sarcasm . -a &#124; ex
So what ? How long did the idea of magical creation out of nothing in 6 days hold prevelance before somebody actually challenged it scientifically ?
And I was correcting you . If you are offended then that &apos;s the breaks .
You mean to tell me that you would deny a woman &apos;s right to her own body for a zygote , yet you have no problem murdering real human beings ? Sounds like a conservative to me ...
Traitor ? More like the boy wised up on the matter . So , Brady , how &apos;s it feel to have all your work and hopes destroyed in the blink of an eye ? How does it feel to know that your last best hope for a disarmed society has abandoned you by the side of the road , and you &apos;re now out of options and the only thing left to do is eat the crow ?
So lets ban cars ... They kill people ... And think all the money could go to public transportation . Also we should ban baseball bats as thats the obvious next step in weaponry ... Don &apos;t forget archery ... Can &apos;t have the subjects have any of that ... Since we are taking away all these weapons to coddle the masses , Will the government be disarming too ? I see a need for both kinds of weapons as a freeman .
What is your theory about the foot fetish gene ?
How would you like to have a parasite in your body and not be given treatment to remove it based solely on the fact that even parasitic organisms are living things and deserve life ? Not pretty is it ? Imagine being one of those guys in the Alien movies and you &apos;ve got a chestburster in you that &apos;s gonna kill you once its fully gestated , but you &apos;re not allowed to have an operation to have it removed from your body because of an intergalatic treaty declaring that all life is precious and must be observed .
Where are those organizations with such scientific rigor ? If they truly do exist , they must be in the position to understand the God of the Gaps they &apos;re worshipping has become microscopic .
And the comments section is usually where the real comedy lies .
gooey cute as this reads , how is this relevant to the philosophy discourse ?
As long as we cut off the privates of the fathers as well .
So your biased reading of the Bible coupled with your personal flaws and your misunderstanding of science is the basis of your religiosity ? Somehow I don &apos;t think that &apos;s something you &apos;d really want to brag about ...
What Would Jesus Carry ?
Yep , suppressing natural behavior is always the way to go . We should also get them to stop pooping .
Actually , they didn &apos;t . The whole tragedy was caused by gun control . If even one student was packing when that occured , 33 lives could have been saved . But no , more victims of botched laws and corrupt politicians .
What if a 13 year old girl comes up to you and asks for sex , and you agree ? Are you forcing yourself on to her ?
In my lifetime , we &apos;ve made huge strides , but there &apos;s a lot more to learn .
&quot; You didn &apos;t bother to read the link , I see , which said : &quot; &quot; During the 70-year Babylonian captivity , from 606-537 B.C. , the southern kingdom of Israel , Judah , had lost it &apos;s national sovereignty , but retained it &apos;s tribal staff or national identity.2 It is very significant that in the book of Ezra we read that during the 70-year Babylonian captivity the Jews still retained their own lawgivers or judges.3 The Jews maintained their identity and judicial authority over their own people even during 70 years of slavery . The scepter had not been lost during the Babylonian captivity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
So are you saying that the people of India aren &apos;t upset about what happened and how the police chose to hide instead of engage the enemy and thus let hundreds of people be violently murdered ? Are you saying that the people of India aren &apos;t seeking changes so they can arm themselves accordingly so if something like this happens again they &apos;ll be better prepared to handle it ?
I see you Americans deal as loosely with the French and Spanish languages , as you do with English ! Surely it is something like Viva Libertad , or Vive la Liberte , but Viva La Liberty ? ? ? ? ? Leo
wow , I never thought a qoute would be so stupid as to compare it to a house . Fine then what if I compare your head to a house that is housing ur brain . But it would be perfectly legal to rip it out and steamroll it on the street for allto see . ( by ur rules of course this would be a perfectly acceptable thing to do )
Do you want them all dead ?
And you think the British would do that ?
What can ya expect when they killed free speech in favor of hate speech tribunals ? Diversity at work maybe ?
I presume that is a joke . Criminals have always had guns ban or not
Just so you don &apos;t shoot them !
&quot; At your service : Comparison I could &apos;ve just circled the whole thing , but this makes it clearer . Plus it &apos;s overall body shape is &quot; &quot; fatter &quot; &quot; &quot;
And I didn &apos;t have to choose to be homosexual . It is a natural inclination . I chose not to hide or lie about who I am . However you are the one who seems to be under the delusion that being gay is a choice . Once again I ask you if it is just a choice then you choose to be gay this moment .
&quot; Actually what sank that debate was a bunch of paleontologists from K state who started arguing for punctuated equilibrium . That was pretty much the end . I remember one board member was quoted as saying &quot; &quot; These are public schools . We are luck if we can teach the kids to read &quot; &quot; &quot;
And if one accepts that gay citizens have equal rights under that Constitution , then one has to accept that a ban on gay marriage is intrinsically unconstitutional .
So biology didn &apos;t exist before the theory of evolution was formulated ?
And you are on intimate terms with the Queen , eh ? By the way , what is it exactly that that little thingy above signifies ? I hope I have used the right emotive whatchamacallit .
Yes , and those apartments are frequently broken into , in the broad daylight , because criminals know that they won &apos;t be harmed .
&quot; The reality is that it &apos;s the ANTI-GAY side who too often include pretenses of &quot; &quot; society imploding &quot; &quot; ... Can you name me anybody who has asserted &quot; &quot; society imploding &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; weight of legal quagmire &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; gay pride movement &quot; &quot; side ? Once again , you run away with pointless strawman arguments ... &quot;
And ends with the woman , whose body is the one having to endure the pregnancy .
Actually quite a common name in South America ... but I know what you mean .
You mean like a tapeworm ? Should removing tapeworms be illegal too ?
So which is it : the action is moral , the action is immoral , or there is no answer ? You seem confused .
Not ! OK , too short , Not !
you know what .. you are right , any unwanted person should be killed . Lets start with nursing homes and then move on to mental health clinics . After that , we should kill all the poor people because they don &apos;t really help society that much . OH ! and don &apos;t forget the handicapped ... who would wanna live like that ? Kill them ... it is merciful ... who cares what they want anyway , they don &apos;t know what they are saying . Then we will have a wonderful society
Go do a Google search and find out . How many babies have you supported killing ?
Because you are a Darwinist - this predictible insult testifies to my rightness . Your approval / compliments would of supported my wrongness . Ray M.
So can women can cure themselves ? Is that what you mean ? Or do you mean that once they forgive themselves they can move on to help other women do the same ? thanks in advance ...
Me , too . I &apos;d probably throw in some counseling as well , just for starters .
&quot; Translation = &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve closed my brain off and I &apos;ve got not nothing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Well any group or individual not spouting left-tard drivel is actually a hate group . The military is of such low intellect that they are easy to sway into hate groups . Hence the homeland insecurity warning on returning veterans .
Hit that one right on the head , Symbiote . I &apos;d like to hear supersport &apos;s response to this .
Could you avoid your constant use of strawman`s fallacies please ?
And if I did then so what ? Hiter &apos;s Mom and Saddam &apos;s Mom both were given the option to abort their pregnancies by nurses and decided against it . So I guess this makes pro-lifers responsible for the holocaust and the slaughter of Kurds ?
Thanks for the complement on intelligence .
Well ... You can apparently read , but what you have apparently chosen to read - and accept - says much .
well that could happen if somhow you mutated into some .. i dunno ... 600 armed person . ?
Well , that is the argument that one hears from creationists so often . So when are you going to get to the most delicious , highly satisfying entertainment ? Even more important , when are you going to expose the theory of evolution ? YOu don &apos;t seriously propose that your little series of cow pies is actually meaningful , do you ?
&quot; And you can be described as a &quot; &quot; pre-dead corpse &quot; &quot; as well . Histrionic revisionist linguistics only serve to push some form of dishonesty agenda that can not stand by itself on the facts . It is the coward &apos;s route . Are you a coward ? ? ? Golly gee . Scared already ? Ah , so the dictionary is the ultimate authority ? And all the way down to the 5th definition no less ? New name for you : &quot; &quot; Dictionary boy . &quot; &quot; Thanks for demonstrating that you really are nothing but a sophist ( Go look THAT up in your precious dictionary ) . &quot;
Yes , you are 100 % correct . Criminals would be sure to pay the tax on their illegally owned pistol , just like they pay income tax on drug money . Oh , wait they don &apos;t pay tax on their drug money . Most criminals break the law you see .
you mean like partially pregnant or almost pregnant or almost a virgin ? I don &apos;t have a beef with God , I only pick on guys shorter or weaker than I.
Great idea . Explain why all the tests that prove it wrong are irrelevant .
&quot; This topic was discussed in another thread . Kelvin said that- &quot; &quot; If it were not the private ownership of guns in 1941 , you would be speaking Japanese if you live on the Westcoast , German if you live on the Eastcoast . &quot; &quot; Urban Legend . It should be illegal for women to have sex . &quot;
Actually yes , but not for the purposes of ilegal search or seisure , I have active duty military friends . They drop by all the time . Obviously your great lack of friends makes that idea hard to understand .
you told me in an earlier post that the mother should die , even if they predict the fetus will kill the mother. your bible states otherwise .
&quot; And you can &quot; &quot; lol &quot; &quot; all you want . So tell me what it is about a brain that has not developed that requires more protection than a brain that is temporarily out of commission ? And yes , we could very well debate potentials , but that is a different branch of the bigger picture and personally I don &apos;t see a reason to go down it , at least not at this point . &quot;
So , by your logic , if there &apos;s a bad cop in New York , then all the cops in Boise , Idaho must be bad as well .
Read what i actually wrote for a change Yank .
Well , you have proven yoruself to be a man with no brain , that is for sure . The definition that was given was the one that scientists use , not the layperson .
OMG Brady , he betrayed HIS PEOPLE ? and I thought WE THE PEOPLE were his people .
Darned Swiss gun laws !
You have to be off for more than 4 days and after that I would get the princely sum of £ 79.15 per week .. hardly worth having . Unlike teachers I cannot stay at home and get paid when it snows too .
Well good at least you are aware there is no reason beyond your opinion of morality against gay marriage . So by all means don &apos;t marry a man and the problem is solved .
Just trying to help out where I can , and if it proves you right well that makes a first time huh ? Sarge its a first ! !
So that &apos;s a problem of “ fundamentalism ” , and not a problem with the one creating the “ parody ” ? Apparently the creation of parodies for “ fundamentalism ” is a large part of atheism .
Including the universe ?
So god is unnatural ?
You could learn a lot from this quote .
Sinjin , we aren &apos;t talking about the 17th and 18th centuries .
And you say juleacatz is the one who views pregnancy as a punishment for women .
And it is heat that resets the clock . Thus it is volcanic rock and ash that can be dated most reliably .
Not all threads need to be courttroom style debates . If you choose to aid in establishing a working consensus fine . If you want simply to rave and rant there are plenty of venues where you can do that . Your participation is welcome as long as you are a participant and are seriously trying to resolve the issue . Otherwise for heavens sake go do something else .
Because you say so ?
I dunno , maybe it was in the third trimester ?
You mean your hypothetical I presume ? Murder violates the rights of the murdered by relieving them of their life . That &apos;s why it &apos;s illegal . You &apos;re a bit slow I see .
The Book of Genesis is either secular or observed history ? Somebody get marc a dictionary , please . ( And I &apos;d link him to a long list of observed instances of speciation , but he &apos;d ignore it yet again . )
&quot; I disagree , it depends on the nature of insult . &quot; &quot; You suck ! What kind of a dumb name is &apos; Robbie &apos; anyway ? &quot; &quot; Hardly requires a stretching of the old grey matter . But the snappy one-liner and the witty retort , or just a carefully crafted insult all require a fair amount of intelligence and insight . Flat out denial requires least thought . I.e. &quot; &quot; you &apos;re wrong ! &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; you &apos;re wrong &apos; cos God says so ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You &apos;re wrong &apos; cos Dawkins says so ! &quot;
&quot; The point is that these laws against cheaply manufactured handguns are no more than economic restrictions on gun ownership . This is similar to old english laws which established actual economic requirements for owning weapons . Gun accidents happening due only to poor construction are rare . This is just another form of people control , keeping weapons out of the hands of the poor so as to lessen their importance in politics . &quot; &quot; Screw them , they can &apos;t do anything about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Also , the world has ended and you are just in denial . We don &apos;t need random assertions , so support your claims !
