A perfect example of why Christian fundamentalismm and evolution can &apos;t co-exist . If God is wrong , then the Bible is wrong . Evolution contradicts the Bible , plain and simple .
That &apos;s not evolution . Life has evolved in the lab , many times .
Sucide ? Isn &apos;t that a mental health issue ? If you take a gun from a sucidal and depressed person , does that cure depression ? If it does that you have addressed the root cause of sucide . If it does not than you really have not done anything to cure the fundamental cause of sucide .
I wish you could put your hands on that poll as well . Until then I &apos;ll remain skeptical . Let &apos;s remember that Democrats and liberals hunt . Remove that group and what &apos;s left ? Something less than 20 % of Americans that own only handguns .
But we have an enumerated Constitutional RKBA . Apples to oranges .
You stand up for women .. I stand up for the child who has no choice Who &apos;s being descrimatory here ?
See above , please cite .
&quot; Theres a book my mom has called &quot; &quot; The trouble with Islam &quot; &quot; by some lady . I don &apos;t know her name , but it looks like it may bee a good book for you . &quot;
&quot; So you would go with the unknowable argument ? Well then this is applicable to your response : So now you have said that god is undefinable or often said &quot; &quot; supernatural &quot; &quot; . T : I believe in God A : What is God ? T : I dont know . Then my question to you would be that if you dont know what God is ... then what is it that you believe in ? &quot;
And what does it matter if they &apos;re in the army reserve , or a lawyer , a teacher , a doctor ?
You know how those anti-gunners are ? they just kinda get stuck in that same old revolving door.Can &apos;t come up with anything new so they rehash .
Thanks , Clive , you &apos;re a good sport . Of course I can &apos;t agree with the XXXXX part . Rash , unwise , unknowledgeable , maybe , but not fools .
Tell me who directed it .
Not heard that before ! made me laugh almost as much as your lettuce eating Tyrannosaur
This why we think you &apos;re a liar. http : / / www.talkorigins.org / faqs / dino ... teocalcin.html
Be wary of names . &apos; junk &apos; DNA is not rubbish ... it &apos;s called &apos; junk &apos; because we don &apos;t know entirely what it is used for ... But just look at all the blank spaces on this post . They are nothing , but they are keeping the words in order . Evolutionaries are putting too much faith in names of words - such as human embryonic &apos; gill slits &apos; or &apos; transitional &apos; fossil
Largely , out of date . To paraphrase myself from earlier , the differences between &apos; then &apos; and &apos; now &apos; are as follows : Increased availability and proficiency of viable alternatives for self-defence . Increased availability and improved variety / design of handguns . Different type of &apos; gun crime &apos; - it is now largely opportunistic . Today &apos;s government need not fear almost any citizens militia , unless absolutely overwhelming . Today &apos;s government is less in need of a ( potential ) extra army to defend against foreign assault . I may have missed some ...
That is the kind , not degree . Chimps are not a higher animal . They are different. interesting
&quot; You need to read what people say more thoroughly , and think about it before you respond . When he said &quot; &quot; can &quot; &quot; ( and there are not many simpler words than that ! ) It didn &apos;t mean &quot; &quot; will &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; must &quot; &quot; , or &quot; &quot; shall &quot; &quot; be more aggressive . It has been shown that in some cases it &quot; &quot; CAN &quot; &quot; happen . It may not have happened with you . It still might , we don &apos;t know . We might even say that it is not likely to happen , but we can &apos;t say that it won &apos;t , because sometimes some people do behave more aggressively when they have a gun . &quot;
Yes it is , police aren &apos;t obligated by the US Constitution to protect individual citizens . If they were , lawsuits could be filed every time a crime is committed , and the police would go bankrupt really quick .
Oh boy , you said it ! Is the Earth &apos;s Magnetic Field Young ?
And here our Government says : Rights and Responsibilities
I &apos;m not sure what the source of the bias would be . Do you mean that it is somehow prejudicial to link ID with creationism , because , somehow ID is scientific while creationism isn &apos;t ? But that &apos;s just not true . In the Dover case the court concluded that ID isn &apos;t science any more than creationism is . In fact , it was clearly demonstrated that the motivation for ID is an effort to disguise the fact that it is nothing more than creationism without the mention of god . Basically , if you scratch an IDer , you get a creationist .
&quot; It is in the first place unclear to whom the &quot; &quot; further harm &quot; &quot; is done . But even granting that the fetus dies , it is not clear how the situation is analogous to abortion , because the intentions of not only the man but even more importantly of the pregnant woman are completely different . &quot;
And so have animals . Plants have been wiped out in the great extinctions too . &#91; quote &#93; Carbon dioxide producing animals could even feed themselves with their own breathe ! &#91; / quot &#93; Huh ? You produce carbon dioxide . How do you propose to feed yourself with that ?
You haven &apos;t proven anything . All you have done is spew your same old drivel which ignores what I actually say and reinterprets it to mean what you want it to say . You must corrupt what I say since you can &apos;t accept the truth of my beliefs and win your fallacious argument .
I believe this is wrong . But this is a private company , and if they want to discriminate based on religion , that &apos;s fine , just as a church may outlaw atheists . Do I agree with it ? No . But does it have to do with our debate ? No . This is about the science classroom . Also , again abiogenesis is a hypothesis , the same level as ID .
And that &apos;s all irrelevent , because pages 240-243 concern what happens in the world today , not what happened concerning creation . His feelings about God &apos;s interactions with the world today would be different if he had a basic knowledge of the Bible .
&quot; Notice that nowhere here do you address the claims and evidence -- which the movie apparently lacks -- about the assertions of &quot; &quot; the expelled . &quot; &quot; Trying to deflect attention from your inability to respond substantively won &apos;t fly with us ; these guys are fudging the stories and sharing only selected pieces in a specific attempt to hide what really happened . For what it &apos;s worth , I feel a hell of a lot more vulnerable as an atheist in my profession and location than IDers should feel in research and teaching academia . &quot;
No , they &apos;re the same species . If you put all these fish in the same pool at the end they would all breed with each other . The example wasn &apos;t of speciation , merely of a change in a population driven by the environment , which is the essense of evolution .
Actually , one can argue that it was a pagan institution long before it was a religious one .
Because the Iliad and Odyssey do not claim to be divine does not mean they should be placed under a different threshold as the Bible . Otherwise , it &apos;s special pleading on your part , and thus logically fallacious . This is one of many inconsistencies between skeptics in regards to the scrutiny of the Bible . They are unwilling to put the standards they have on the Bible against other books similar in age . If they did , there would not be a single book left standing .
I think the OP said it pretty well . If an organism or cell can process information and then make decisions based on that information , that &apos;s intelligence .
To say nothing of the possible threats to people &apos;s safety , if not actual acts of violence .
Having human DNA does not necessarily make one a human being . Transgenic animals can have human DNA , does that make them human beings .
Not this time . That was the previous attempt by the good people of Kansas .
And religious folk in the south used the Bible to justify enslavement of thousands or millions of blacks , and also to justify their treating blacks as mere property . I suppose ( but am not familiar enough with all of the details to know for sure ) that some even used the Bible to justify linching blacks .
There &apos;s a distinct difference ... so what ? No baby at any age can live outside the womb . It still needs care and attention like any other . This difference in age doesn &apos;t mean anything .
I &apos;m not surprised . That &apos;s a typical response when someone calls your bluff . Waxy
If guns laws don &apos;t affect criminals then how do you explain the low rates of criminal gun use in nations like the UK ?
Didn &apos;t supersport openly admit he could not prove his own beliefs in divine creation ? For all his dishonesty , you have to admit he &apos;s more honest and forthcoming then Marc or AA have been .
Is that not agnostic ? You leave yourself open to change if evidence dictates it . Sorry if this is just turning into word games .
What about the pain and death inflicted upon the innocent women and girls forced to give birth ? Have you no regard for them ?
Give it a rest ... what is evident here is more coffeehouse vasilation on your part ... no foam .
How is that silly ? You do realize that the vast majority of firearms used in crimes are stolen no ? And many of those are stolen from legal buyers . While it is a poor argument to argue that firearms should be banned for that primary reason , the underlying principle of control over supply is hardly silly . Unless you think that control over nuclear weapons is silly . Maybe you would . After all , you are Isly .
Fossils show inherited change . Adaptation does not .
They are both written in the bible . Neither of them have any evidence ( apart from the bible ) to support their existence . One of them has been proven to be utterly false . This naturally discredits the other , as they appear in the same publication by the same author . Why decide one is true when the other is clearly not , and neither have any other supporting evidence ?
Hate to have to spoil things , but the rest of the world has really no interest at all in Kansas and its scholastic problems
&quot; Upon reviewing the golden rule &quot; &quot; do unto others as you would have them do unto you &quot; &quot; I see nothing of any other &apos; side . &apos; It &apos;s very clear--treat others the way you &apos;d want to be treated . No one wants to be treated badly , so if you follow the golden rule , you &apos;ll be benevolent . &quot;
I believe once you have the rights granted persons that they may not be taking away because you are asleep or in a coma . Not unless of course it can be shown that higher brain activity has ceased and there is no reasonable expectation that it could return .
What , specifically , are you witnessing ? A baby being born ? A prayer apparently being answered ? A near miss ? Mysterious coincidences that you interpret as being the work of God ? Or do you see dead people rising up out of the grave ? And people walking on water ? And people turning water into wine and feeding a crowd with a small amount of food ? What kind of miracles are we talking about here ?
Oh really ? Parts of New Orleans were under water for more than 40 days before all the water receeded . Hasn &apos;t the plant life there replenished naturally in the wild ? Of course it has . The Earth is very able to repair itself in spite of modern mans sense of self importance . Here &apos;s some interesting photographic evidence of it. www.pbase.com / andrys / noah
&quot; Well , at least accoreding to your &quot; &quot; because I say so &quot; &quot; belief . The woman , of course , don &apos;t need to pay attention to your desire to control her own body in bondage to your particular brand of outraged morality . &quot;
Yes . The first one isolated was a frame-shift mutation on a plasmid . A fairly common source of useful mutations in bacteria .
No . You &apos;ve not understood what I said . I don &apos;t know how to make it perfectly clear to you ... the reason the skin color vs. homosexuality analogy is not valid is that one is in 100 % of the cases studied a result of uncontrollable genetic inheritance and the other is generally not .
Actually Electro , do you remember this thread ? Evidence for a flood ? Oddly enough it took 20 pages before one of them even tried to argue against the reasons why the flood did not occur .
And , what percentage is that ? How was the poll conducted ? Who conducted it ? How was the determination made about who was a &apos; scientist &apos; ?
No it doesn &apos;t , as abortion WAS a legal option in this case . This was not a legality issue , but an education issue .
A lot of work has been done on that topic . I would recommend reading Debating Design from Darwin to DNA It is a monster of a book , but it is definitely worth the read .
Well , if burglars want to steal guns then it makes sense that they would be likely to target the homes of gun owners . And the source is from the recently published book Evaluating Gun Policy which you can read and review . The source is listed at the bottom .
If your friend is hearing voices in her head to walk into traffic , she needs some psychiatric help .
That &apos;s the thing , though ; even a self-professed non-expert can perfectly well refute the ridiculous points supersport continually spouts. supersport , on the other hand , doesn &apos;t know any better .
Actually your posts are providing increasing evidence for just how simple folks can get .
I think you need to look up euthanasia , and not only for the correct grammar . Those examples are not euthanasia . Abortion is not the same thing as euthanasia . Why don &apos;t you just say what is on your mind , rather than setting these ham-handed traps you hope someone will fall into ? It is clear what your opinion is . If you have something to say , by all means express yourself .
The 7 day creation I am referring to , not merely the possibility of divine creation through the Big bang etc
See my post above , Hi. marc ignores fundamentals of Miller &apos;s beliefs that he clearly spells out in trying to push his anti-Miller argument .
The biblical end has got to be near . This was a Doctor who spends all of his life saving people &apos;s lives .
&quot; In my reading of the Declaration ( and using the 1st . Amendment as a filter ) it doesn &apos;t matter who or what the founders meant by &quot; &quot; Creator . &quot; &quot; The conlusion is the same ; regardless . Namely ; The fact that the founders considered our basic rights to be inherrent . &quot;
Pregnancy is a health issue only for the woman . Your glib remark pretending to sympathy is insulting .
&quot; Actually , I think Kronos is right in this case--at least from the standpoint of most consitutional scholars . Of course the framers didn &apos;t envision the wording to be used in this way for this purpose--this is what &apos;s simply called a &quot; &quot; loophole &quot; &quot; , in this case anyway . It &apos;s why there has been an effort in recent years to close the loophole with a constitutional amendment defining marriage . &quot;
&quot; Since when are profetallifers &quot; &quot; reasonable people &quot; &quot; ? How reasonable can it be for them to try to impose their particular answer to a metaphysical question on others who believe differently ? &quot;
&quot; To force women to have babys that they dont even want is even more &quot; &quot; preposterous &quot; &quot; . &quot;
I would kind of Like to Discuss your Fascinating use of Caps . But seriously , your numbers are insane . Somewhere around 8000 gay couples have gotten married in the past couple of years , how in the world do you imagine that they &apos;ve cost the state hundreds of thousands or millions each ? You just made all that up , didn &apos;t you ?
&quot; But I don &apos;t hear you saying things like &quot; &quot; baseball is always harmful to the player &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; baseball is something no one should have to go through . &quot; &quot; You see , if pro-choicers only used the &apos; pregnancy-is-bad-if-forced argument , they might have a point , but they often don &apos;t add the last part . Besides , no one ever forces a woman to get pregnant in the first place . &quot;
Thank God . I too hope it doesn &apos;t keep going back and forth . While I live across the river in Parkville , Missouri , I used to live in Overland Park Kansas and went to school there . I think they are generally pretty good public schools , it &apos;s just the state school board that keeps effing everything up when they get some christonazis on board .
Obama overturns ban on overseas abortion funding I thought abortion was the fix for bad or no family planning
Paranoia is so ugly . It &apos;s not OK to teach scientific theory but it is OK to tell them that mythology is fact ?
Every relationship does entail moral obligations in one way or another , but the argument is that there is no relationship that morally obligates one to share ones body . They are trying to generalize &apos; moral obligations &apos; as if that justifies anything . There are things that cannot be morally obligated , no matter the relationship , so the argument tries to prove .
&quot; That should be , &quot; &quot; duh &quot; &quot; . I knew what you meant . A bit of humor is ok . But I guess you don &apos;t have anything to say about the implications of this study . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;d say no to the first part , and yes to the second . The &quot; &quot; information theory &quot; &quot; argument is something that gets brought up on forums alot , generally by people who don &apos;t know what information theory is , but I &apos;ve never seen an &quot; &quot; official &quot; &quot; ID person claim it as a central argument . The basic argument is that stuff , from the universe , to people , to eyeballs , to DNA , is too complex to have &quot; &quot; just happened &quot; &quot; . Someone , ( and they won &apos;t say God , cause their not trying to be religious here , oh no ... ) must have designed them . &quot;
&quot; Because she , like every other political figurehead , thinks it &apos;s alright for her to carry a gun , but not anybody else . If she DIDN &apos;T support a ban on all firearms , then why did she say &quot; &quot; If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban , picking up every one of them -- Mr. and Mrs. America , turn them all in -- I would have done it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Go pound sand . You &apos;re the people who want the Separation of Church and State , remember ? Get your sick , satanic mits off the church .
Gary Ridgway , the serial murderer of some 60 or more women , possibly more .
You mean , the perpetrator is convicted and the defender acquitted ? Yes , that &apos;s the rule and not the exception . Notice here how no-one ended up dead , or even particularly seriously injured . Additionally the circumstances described are incredibly rare , that &apos;s why it makes the news .
Humans cannot cleanse themselves of their sins .
I believe abortion is murder and should be illegal . The only possible circumstance when an abortion should be an option is when the “ LIFE ” of both the mother and her unborn child is at risk . When both lives are going to be lost , it is better to save one as opposed to losing two . The holocaust on the unborn children of this country is something that we should be ashamed of as a country .
Yes . ( and this is to add stuff to make the post stick .... )
Yes , every living thing is made up of cells .
I disagree for the same reasons I have been giving all along . There may be some legislation that was passed that has kept corporations small ( Anti-trust ) but did it really benefit the society ?
&quot; If this is what passes for American healthcare , then your need for change is even more desperate . None of these &quot; &quot; treatments &quot; &quot; is available on the NHS . &quot;
Cornell &apos;s writings consistently place him within the collective right camp . Even the arguments that are attributed to him which start this thread show his collective right desire . His claim to neutrality in the individual / collective right debate is as disingenuous as his interpretations of the SCOTUS opinions in both Miller and Cruikshank : Greatest Threat to Second Amendment ? Greatest Threat to Second Amendment ? Whether ? neutral ? or not , Cornell has proven himself capable of distorting SCOTUS opinions when he does not find that they suit his collective right tastes .
So sorry ; I have a friend who works and lives in the D.C. area , but he has residency in Mass . , because he owns a home there . And he was able to be married only because he owns a home there ?
What &apos;s your claim ? That the seasonal molt of arctic foxes is evolution or that it is not ? As usual , your responses show muddled thinking .
You mean to tell me it &apos;s a falsehood ? ? I don &apos;t believe it .
Is that all you &apos;ve got ?
Are you sure ? What about animals that had a combination of both long and short hair . Such fur would function more efficiently as insulation that either long or short alone .
I think you present a good point , but part of the test here is to see how my post is reponded to ; silence from certain people tells us things in inself . So far it seems my initial estimation of the issue is about right- the idelogy being upheld helps some people ignore the effect the punitive policy imposes .
Why should I prove anything , you never do .
GOD was proved not to exist many years ago details if you wish . GOD was proved to exist many years ago details if you wish . IRAQ was proven many years ago to be a justifiable war . \ IRAQ was proven many years ago to be a non-justifiable war . And so it goes . Most such proofs are hot air , unsupported distrortions . Hovind is of course good at that particular game .
Well , here is my take on it . I really believe that only the truly evil end up in Hell . Those like Hitler . I think that anyone else goes to heaven - Wiccans , Atheists , Buddhists , etc . - anyone who follows Christ &apos;s message of love , tolerance , and acceptance , whether knowingly or not . Those who preach hate , and those who act on that hate , like Hitler , the KKK , and any other person / persons filled with hate ( sad to say , this seems to apply to our own friend Archie here ) are the ones who will end up in hell .
And rightfully so .
Just another anti-gun Blogger . I could go on , but doing so would boar the heck out of everyone , to include me !
Are there truly laws of logic ? Where are they encoded ?
I think you fail to take into account that for most opposers of abortion , they genuinely feel they are trying to save lives by their opposition . In many cases it &apos;s not a matter of trying control sexual prermissiveness in society but preventing lives from being killed . Disagree or not , you can &apos;t separate the anti-abortion message from the fact that it holds to the view that abortion is a form of murder .
Because I am one who likes see things from different angles . What better way to fight your enemies then to understand their viewpoint . Before I am attacked on the the last statement , just because I understand a viewpoint does not meant that I accept it as true or that I don &apos;t reject it .
Sure , here ya go ... Radiocarbon Dating
The process of evolution has no scientifically known teleology and follows no known predestined plan . It does not teach that there cannot be any such things as teleology or forethought . This is where your mistake lies .
And those pillars will be replaced by something stronger like equality and Justice .
So would you care if abortion were outlawed . If so , what would be bad about allowing a view that places objective value in human life to be the basis for making law ?
It &apos;s remarkable then , how much progress we &apos;ve made . You may or may not approve of the theory , but it works very well at learning more about biology .
Then there &apos;s that state thaht wants to remove the use of BC and AD from the calendar . I guess they &apos;ll change it to some neutral like plus and minus numbers just to stay with the rest of the world .... or maybe 2005 will change to 133,956,373,278 .
It &apos;s your article , not mine
Apologies , that wasn &apos;t my intention . My meaning was this ; while it was your conclusion , your use of it as an unsupported &apos; fact &apos; forced us to treat it as an assumption . We had no way by which we could make it a conclusion - that &apos;s the purpose of this thread !
Why conception ? When a mature ovum leaves the ovary , it has every potential of turning into a human being . How dare I stand idly by while that potential life is wasted , unfertilized ? No ; clearly , it is my duty to try to reach that ovum with my seed . God said to be fruitful and multiply , so I am just following God &apos;s will .
ABORTION IS NOT BAD . That &apos;s all that needs to be said .
It varies . Sometimes elementary / middle school kids and sometimes older minors like high school kids . I not talking about gangbangers if this is where you &apos;re going .
Maybe He doesn &apos;t punish them .
From your own link it is very clear the NRA DID NOT say that or publish that . Your clearly very wrong .
I &apos;m not arguing that gun control will change the nature of men- though guns may make them more willing and confident to engage in crime . With guns criminals can do even more damage . Adding guns to crime is like adding gasoline to a fire- it makes an already existing problem worse . If you think that just as many people die from stabbing and beatings in other developed nations as people die from guns in the US then you need to do more research .
&quot; And it doesn &apos;t stop there . Another of my favorites is how they loudly criticize radiometric dating ( most commonly radiocarbon dating because they know no other kind ) then shout from the rooftops that radiometric dating confirms the &quot; &quot; genuineness &quot; &quot; of ~ 2000 year old manuscripts ... &quot;
Oh you little tramp !
&quot; And you &apos;ve been failing miserably , partly because your definition of &quot; &quot; atheism &quot; &quot; is asinine . Even most Christians would disagree with you . &quot;
I have no idea what this could possibly mean . It makes no sense , semantically or logically . It is so vague as a concept as to be worthless in terms of the pursuit of knowledge .
No , actually they used the Bible as a basis for their morality . They then applied that morality to the design of a system of government that they wanted to create . Maybe the majority of Americans are comfortable with the status quo WRT their morals . Who are you to tell them that they have to change for you ?
No I do not say that the creation of energy and matter did not coincide the creation of the laws that govern / regulate them . What I say is that the laws are not the RESULTS of the existence of energy , matter etc .
I say that you need to take into consideration the number of criminals that &apos;ll disregard the lock and try and break down the door anyway . That &apos;s why smart people don &apos;t rely exclusively on locks and security systems for their own protection .
I know ... I know . I agree with you that it &apos;s sad more of those people couldn &apos;t or didn &apos;t take advantage of concealed carry to help prevent so many deaths . That needs to change along with education so more people can defend themselves .
One shouldn &apos;t assume ignorance on the part of creationists . That is a mistake that too many evolutionists make . In the real world , we have people willing to say things they already know isn &apos;t true . Why should creationists be any different ? After all , they are people , too . But rather than accept that fact , evolutionists argue that creationists are ignorant of a subject when , in reality , they ( creationists ) were simply telling lies .
So you are saying the US system is better ?
That sentence doesn &apos;t even make sense . Did it occur to you that you should actually think about what you are going to say and express actual ideas ?
When talking to a person professing Christianity , the Bible is binding . If the Bible advises that abortion is murder , then it is so regardless of what the secular systems of the day have to say about it . When talking with one accepting the principles of Christianity , the premiere of those being that the Bible is binding , the existence of the soul is not up for debate . The position of Bassman , I believe , would be that there is no legitimate right to terminate a pregnancy , especially from the stand-point of the Bible , which of course , is binding to those professing Christianity .
If this is true , then it should cover the fetus since there is no difference between the fetus and the infant besides size and location . Every adult was once a teen , every teen was once a child , every child was once an infant and every infant was once a fetus .
More likely the criminal will shoot first rather than give the other chap a chance . There is no real reason for the average citizen to need or have a hand-gun
Actually , I don &apos;t have any respect for creationism in most of it &apos;s varied forms . I have had great respect for several individual creationists that I have met . But they earned that respect .
Well he has further political aspirations .......... The 9th circuit in Sodom ( SF ) is always making law instead of interpreting it ........ That is why they are over ruled so often .......
He was using it as an example . He was saying that if something in your life causes you to sin , get rid of it ! BTW , thanx for giving me the references to your verses ! It is really annoying to have to search through the Bible to find verses that people quote without references .
No , but the Roman persecution of Christians , covering Christians in pitch , Roman garden parties , witnesses for Christ being killed for their faith etc. is as irrelevant as it gets . Just be careful , that &apos;s all I &apos;m saying . There is a place for that topic .
&quot; Yes , I believe there will be a lot more to come ( as you said , just look at the &quot; &quot; hobbits &quot; &quot; that were recently discovered ) . I love this sort of look into the migrations of everyone over the last 160,000 years or so . &quot;
sinjin - I didn &apos;t mean to imply any linkage between your opinions and those of another poster . Apologies .
&quot; So we agree ..... What I want to know is why the vocal homosexual &apos; lobby &apos; insists on the term &quot; &quot; marriage ? &quot; &quot; emclean , the sanctity of marriage would not be the only thing about marriage to be ( harmed ? ) changed . The whole definition of marriage would change , too . &quot;
That &apos;s simply not true ;
Yes ... if you ignore people , they eventually go away ... except for me , of course .
No. you &apos;re not making any sense . Where is symbiote ? I got a horrible argument for him to dispell .
Just because you don &apos;t have a handle on what civil rights are doesn &apos;t make the phrase arbitrary . It &apos;s a legal term , not a catch phrase . I &apos;m not a lawyer , I couldn &apos;t track down the exact definition they use in Massachusetts , but rest assured they have one .
You know &apos; my kind &apos; ? How very presumptuous on your part . Then you know individual choice is the issue , not enforced medical procedures . You didn &apos;t answer the question regarding pregnant women who intend to carry to term being required to have a sonogram .
Actually , after the fact calculations on either side are just noise . Humans do exist and I suspect that all statements of probabilities are incorrect . Further , I don &apos;t think that coin flips are relevant and not even a very good analogy .
The tactics pro-lifers use make the Nazis look like the little league . I mean , seriously . The reason we are dealing with terrorism is because women have the right to the abortion procedure . Wow . Please give me one way those two things relate to each other .
Evidence or proof for that delusion ?
Well , one person got it right ... where in the constitution does it say something about health having to be protected ?
&quot; So you know how foolish you are and hope that name calling will distract from that being recognized by everyone . Erectus skulls were smaller because the brain was smaller . You brought up KNM-WT 15000 ( Turkana Boy ) and you weren &apos;t even aware that as an adult he would have been about 6 &apos; 1 &quot; &quot; tall ? Why is his skull smaller than modern humans ? &quot;
But you are smart enough to realize that the ban on gay marriage has nothing to do with it .
&quot; putting words in my mouth again ? i did not say christian , i said &quot; &quot; God &quot; &quot; . Christian , Jewish , and Muslim all believe in the same &quot; &quot; God &quot; &quot; . - XXXXX. i &apos;ll let Crim and Lurch respond to the others ; lets not let me have all the fun . &quot;
And folks that refuse to see the legitimate ones put us all at risk . Touche .
Wrong and no one has ever called bone marrow an inner sanctum and I don &apos;t know what a baby &apos;s tabernacle might be .
I may be a pro-gunner but what doe &apos;s that have to do with with gay rights ? Since I &apos;m a pro- gunner I won &apos;t force my life style or views on you , if you don &apos;t force yours on me.Deal ? After all you seem to be the expert on gay rights .
* * * * * * * * . Utter fraking * * * * . Scientists have already accumulated mounds of evidence which suggest the common ancestor . You choose to ignore it as do most scientifically ignorant christians .
Is there something wrong with choosing to have a cheese sandwich as opposed to peanut butter and jelly ? Do you prefer actually having to make personal moral choices or do you need a rigid and inviolable instruction manual to run your life ?
my my you are up on the current events . Thanks for shedding light on this for everyone here .
Oh ? Don &apos;t you think that since Jesus said that whosoever so much as hated their brother without a cause is a murder ? Or are you Jewish and don &apos;t believe the New Testament ? Is that why you say the Bible says nothing about abortion , or just plain killing at all ?
I got an interesting tid bit for you : http : / / www.2ampd.net / Articles / difiElitist.htm First read the text . The anti-gun senator is noted for having the ONLY legal concealed gun in the city of San Francisco . Also note as a person who carried a concealed gun and still keeps a .357 magnum for protection , that she should KEEP YOUR FINGER OFF THE TRIGGER , until your aming at your target .
My responses are in bold .
Yes , the horror of voluntarily taking orders from someone in exchange for monetary rewards ! ! If you hate your job that much , quit . You aren &apos;t being oppressed because someone offered you the option to do something . If you don &apos;t like it , don &apos;t do it . If you hate trade , you can go wander through the wilderness and eat berries and roots .
Just a newly-evolved structure . It happens .
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahahahahahaha . The deliberately out-of-context quotes again that directly contradict the conclusions of the authors .
And how is your think group any different , you all think alike just as gun owners all think alike . So stop calling the kettle black .
This makes more sense then anything else I &apos;ve heard on this thread .
I do not argue so much the quality of llife of an individual woman but more for the quality of life , indeed of having access to life itself , of the children of the woman involved , because in many situations the concern and nurturance of a mother may be the only thing keeping children alive , especially in poor , war-torn nations that do not enjoy the relative wealth of the United States .
College . They are normally studied for two years between the ages of 16 and 18 before going to uni .
Tell that to CDC pathologists . Or just read this post . ETA : Alternatively , let &apos;s look at the logic in this way : because the field of quantum mechanics is useless for helping me describe classical physical systems , quantum mechanics must be wrong . I think this illustrates the fallacy satisfactorily .
Well , not completely , but yes , quite the same . However , this is irrelivent- she wasn &apos;t a person , because she was in a coma . Does that give me the right to kill her ? Of course not ! What about fetuses born in comas ? Can we kill them ? What about people in vegetative states ? After all , they arn &apos;t perfect , so let &apos;s kill them !
Pretty good considering Darwin wasn &apos;t aware of genetics . Too bad Wells is stuck in 1859 . The modern synthesis provides perfectly legitimate mechanisms .
Don &apos;t expect your misrepresentations of the findings of those studies to sink in . I &apos;m not that easily fooled .
It is an acronym for &apos; Y &apos;oung &apos; E &apos;arth &apos; C &apos;reationist . In other words ... someone who believes that the earth is only 6,000 - 10,000 years old and was created in six days by a being known as God .
Got evidence to back that up ? ? I &apos;m not sure how a stoner &apos;s worse than an alcoholic really . -Wez
Then show the evidence .
But I think that is the point . What if you didn &apos;t agree with the germ theory of disease ? Does that mean that it shouldn &apos;t be taught in health classes in our schools ? Should it be replaced by the bad humors of night air theory ? But not everyone agrees with that theory either .
If I am to believe in something even if it &apos;s scientific , I should be able to challenge the belief &apos;s of the person who &apos;s pushing it . If they don &apos;t believe in what they &apos;re selling , why should I.
I don &apos;t understand your question . If law-abiding gun owners were overwhelming those who should not have access to guns , those who use guns unlawfully , I would be very pleased . But , as far as I can see , the only goal of the gunners is to make sure that everyone has a gun , no matter how insane , no matter how stupid , no matter how incapable they may be to own such easy-to-use instruments of death .
You should have said that . I might have agreed with you .
I &apos;ll have to apologize here , SoC . I confused you with another poster who also used Christ in his handle . You didn &apos;t run from the topic because you weren &apos;t the OP of that thread . Sorry about that . If you &apos;d still like to approach that thread , I &apos;ll respond and provide the link , but all readers should be clear that my accusation that SoC scampered away was mistaken , and any willingness to address the arguments would be solely to SoC &apos;s credit .
But they didn &apos;t have sexual relations . This was from a sperm bank- there was nothing that made the two people create one being . Nonetheless , this is a side issue for future debates . My main point is homosexuality is a disorder that the government shouldn &apos;t be condoning . The government obviously doesn &apos;t condone pedophilia , poligamy , and incest . Why is the government condoning homosexuality ?
No I don &apos;t think that tying your tubes is abortion . I only think abortion comes into play when there is actually cells forming to make a baby , and you get them scraped out , or abort a baby before or after the third trimester . Plus I heard that if you tie the tubes , when you decide you want a baby you can untie the tubes , to conceive a baby . But burning is another thing . But unless there is actual cells forming it is not abortion
And yet the atheist belief system allows for everyone to have their own seperate set of morals . According to the Atheist system , what Hitleror Stalin did was perfectly moral because those atheists believed that what they were doing was moral . Disgusting if you ask me .
Some references please ? In general , it seems that most climatologists agree that severe weather systems will occur more frequently with an increase in average global temperature . ( ref : http : / / www.grida.no / climate / ipcc _ tar / wg2 / 061.htm # 1434 )
You weren &apos;t referring to your home in your little story of helplessness .
You pointed out someone that had 6 fingers . I said that making a copy is not creating anything new , I never mentioned anything about reproduction .
Mormons believe that Satan is the brother of Jesus .
Things like future proof of a young earth - evolution needs billons of years . Or proof of severe weather conditions that would destroy the evolutionary process . Life on earth dies completely if it gets out of a fairly narrow temperature range , any time during those billions of years .
What is astounding about it ? If we had been aborted , we wouldn &apos;t have known anything about it . Untold billions of conceptions have been spontaneously aborted . Do you shed tears for those , too ?
Pretty much every experiment ever carried out in a petri-dish ; take your pick Also the revisited peppered moth experiment I linked to earlier .
They do not hate the concept , they merely reject it as being useful or necessary to explain the material universe . I mean come on what utility would a physics which incorporated miracles be ? Nothing would be predictable and all utility would be lost . If you want all of science to be arbitrary and unreliable then all ya gotta do is inject miracles into the field . For example what value is f = ma { except when the diety wills otherwise } . Or e = mc2 ( god willing )
No , there really aren &apos;t . As for Robertson , why do you think I said he was right ( as in global warming is happening and we are largely responsible ) by sheer luck ?
Your stats aren &apos;t broken down into meaningful groups , so nothing is learned WRT Muslims .
Well , sort of . It isn &apos;t necessary , but if you &apos;re predicting intelligence from what someone does rather than direct measurements of physical properties , knowing their motivation level might allow you to make more accurate predictions . Nevertheless even without knowing the subjects &apos; motivations at all , today &apos;s generic intelligence tests still have excellent predictive power for success in both school and employment , and are perhaps better predictors for future success than any other method we have ( including interviews , personality inventories , aptitude in a particular field )
This is retarded . A species would be defined by the genome , not which organs work the way they are supposed to or not .
Because you &apos;ve presented no credible evidence to support the claims that private transactions are an established and major source of firearms for criminals . If you can &apos;t prove it &apos;s broken , you don &apos;t have grounds to call for fixing it .
You then cite the Wikipedia entry on Spencer :
&quot; and how do you know this ...... oh I see ... you said &quot; &quot; I think &quot; &quot; .... but you don &apos;t really &quot; &quot; know &quot; &quot; what most Americans favor or don &apos;t favor ... you just &quot; &quot; think &quot; &quot; &quot;
I say , since there are medical uses for the stuff , the drug is not pure harm ( as the authoritarians assert . ) Marijuana has its benefits and harms , and some of these benefits boil down to a matter of personal preference . Illegalizing it , in effect , dictates a personal preference .
Bonus question : ( Can you spot the grammatical error within the quoted text ? )
Like the docking simulation , in development there is a pre-existing fitness landscape ( the womb ) . Both processes converge on similar endpoints each time it is run , both process are biased to a few endpoints and both processes reach local optima ( e.g. skin cells ) after the process id complete. http : / / mybroadband.co.za / vb / picture .... pictureid = 1857 Figure 1 : Similarities between development and a docking simulation employing a memetic algorithm . There are certainly many parallels between our own designed simulated docking runs and the development of life .
You consider the county to be like Rosa Parks ? ? ?
Sure . The outcome of Heller vs DC and Florida Shall - Issue laws support that statement . According to Brady logic , the more helpless you are , the safer you are from criminals .
&quot; Well right there , you used an oxymoron , &quot; &quot; Great &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Evangelist &quot; &quot; got together about as well as Military Inteligence . Secondly , as I stated before ... you left too many other questions unanswered about the &quot; &quot; Preacher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
You either did not read my post thoroughly , or are intentional misrepresenting me . Post 250 ( which I had actually read before starting this thread ) is nothing but DamEtel rambling about homologies between vertebrae embryos . That has absolutely nothing to do with the unexplained homologies that the Denton talks about . Evolution simply cannot , reasonably speaking , account for the homology between your arm and leg , among other examples .
It &apos;s evidence of EAM . Probably she comes from a large family . Her mother always had her hands full and was on her feet day and night .
Nobody should be forced to even have a sonagram . I think that you &apos;ll find reasonable pro-life and pro-abortion people believe that much .
&quot; Really ? Intra-species evolution and inter-species evolution are one and the same ? * edit * I was reading on micro-evolution in wikipedia , here is what they had to say ... is this incorrect ? &quot; &quot; Typically , observable instances of evolution are examples of microevolution ; for example , bacterial strains that have become resistant to antibiotics . Because microevolution can be observed directly , both pro-evolution and some anti-evolution groups agree that it is a fact of life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
And an even funnier thing is it won &apos;t affect his wallet at all .
Sorry , but that &apos;s not in the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment . Try again .
So redemption is not a possibility ? They did their time , paid the penalty , and just want their rights as a citizen returned to them .... l
Well if you just shoot someone and they die then they dont get their day in court so they dont get due process . The fifth says you cant lose your life without due process .
you should be allowed to buy as many as you want to
That and VOR keeps flip flopping on his positions and he refuses to clarify his contridictions .
Incorrect . Evolution is not something that must be adhered to . It is a scientific theory . As such , if evidence was brought to light that evolutionary theory couldn &apos;t account for , then the theory would be altered or scrapped . It &apos;s really quite simple .
Not true Our laws were originally founded on the precepts of the 10 commandments ........
I am hardly a phyicist , but I am under the impression that there is at least some people who feel there is reason that there are &apos; uncaused causes &apos; . I think that the terms used are &apos; Vacuum flucuations &apos; , and &apos; virtual particles &apos; . I am not aware of any peer reviewed articles on it , but a popular press book is &apos; Achilles in the quantum world &apos; by Richard Morris .
Genes transfered horizontally are as subject to selection as anyother form of gene . Once intergrated into the recieving genome they are simply one more heritable element and if they alter the phenotypes ( many are either neutral or even inactivatee ) then of course they are subject to selection . Why do you think otherwise ? Remember that horizontal transfer is a rare event roughly on a par with ordinary mutations .
Again , we never said that a human fetus was a different species .
Hello there . The principle behind a pro-life Christian supporting the death penalty ( I am one ) is this : We are talking of innocent life . The death penalty is justified for a person who is guilty of commiting a crime against a society that has that law . The child never did anything wrong . I know of other beleivers who don &apos;t support the death penalty , so basically , it &apos;s an in-house debate .
It stops us from saying we ara a rational people . I don &apos;t support any laws that would allow a father not to have a say so about his child being aborted . Are there any ? ? If it were a life or death thing for the mother no question . As I stated I don &apos;t like the idea but making it illegal would simply put more unwanted kids in state homes . Lets take care of the living first !
Actually , it &apos;s not . The big bang theory is also science . What exactly do you think the big bang theory is ? What evidence do you think supports it ? What evidence is there against it ? why do you disagree ? What is your education in cosmology - in other words , why is your disagreement rational ?
Excellent point Doc
Your wrong . Airplanes and courthouses are gun free zones but these places never have massacres .
No proof anyone ever went from gay orientation to straight orientation .
Actually they do . Whether or not you think they should is another matter entirely . Did you not notice where the article came from ? From a paper in India . I also found articles on the same subject from papers all over the country as well as in other countries such as Romania . Save your snobbery for someone else .
Then why does the following occur ?
So the intent hiding behind abortion laws all along was to keep women in the gutter . There was not any legititamte concern for the unborn fetus . It was all about how they could keep women down . Tell me then , would someone who supports a ban on partial birth abortion do so simply because they want to repress women ?
&quot; You are getting to a more complicated area where &quot; &quot; mental existence &quot; &quot; no longer matters . I &apos;ve explained earlier that it isn &apos;t exactly the same as &quot; &quot; self defense &quot; &quot; so I don &apos;t think a similiar response is needed . Furthermore , you are saying mental existence is not solely the thing that gives you value but rather it depends on outside influences and chance . At some point it just seems like the stance on abortion is that the woman is more important no matter what . This is why I claim some will rank humans above other humans ... a dangerous precedent which we have tried before . &quot;
But they are implemented completely differently .
And yet you have no problem with this law Galileo ?
Gun control maintains its racist roots even in this day and age . What other reason would there be for Form 4473 to ask applicants what their race is ? What is the importance of knowing if somebody &apos;s white , black or mexican when they &apos;re buying a gun ?
Look up the evolution of colour vision in primates . It &apos;s my personal favourite - but what do you think ?
Because when something passes every experiment thrown at it and when something fits observation better than anything else , then it &apos;s as near as damnit fact . We can get pedantic over this if you want , but the conclusion that reaches is that there are no facts .
&quot; Problem is , you think requiring a woman not to kill someone is &quot; &quot; treating them as breeding animals &quot; &quot; . Kind of an odd thought . &quot;
&quot; Well , I don &apos;t believe in evolution . I believe in things for which I have no evidence . And while it is true that everyone has bias , using correct science and the process of peer review works to eliminate . Not all is perfect , and people are people , but overall the system works . Not a lot of bad science gets through . In the case of &quot; &quot; creation science &quot; &quot; we know that there is no science involved . Only talk that sounds scientific . There is no hypothesis , prediction or testing . Only ad hoc stories constructed of selected bits of evidence to support the foregone conclusion . &quot;
As is obvious , not all would .
&quot; You &apos;re thinking is right on , sinjin . Although it &apos;s kinda hush-hush , it has been determined ( especially in the more charismatic churches ) that when one &quot; &quot; goes further &quot; &quot; in religion the other feels alienated and problems / troubles that probably would have never risen in their relationship oozes out . A new circle of friends emerge which make the one that is &amp; # 8220 ; left behind &amp; # 8221 ; feel closed out and closed off . Arguments then seem to erupt daily and most of it over who is doing the &amp; # 8220 ; right thing &amp; # 8221 ; according to that religion , followed all too often by divorce . &quot;
Because the effectiveness of other methods don &apos;t come close to that of owning a gun for personal protection . If they did then the police wouldn &apos;t have guns because it would be redundant and not cost effective .
Just so you know , the majority of Japanese cars sold in the US are also assembled in the US and thus provide Americans with thousands of jobs at these plants .
Why is that propoganda ? It &apos;s exactly what you do .
Another oft-repeated lie .
What in the Hell does evolution have to do with people doing bad things ? I am a believer in creation by God and have never heard such drivel . BOY-HOWDY ! ! !
And science helped Stenger write his book . How can the same subject make a stronger case for both of two completely opposing viewpoints ? another
&quot; Really ! Then I assume that you have read Darwin - at least On the Origin of Species . Otherwise you are babbling . Please cite specific passages from Darwin &apos;s books where he made &quot; &quot; morals and ethics &quot; &quot; a joke . Please also do the same for the works of Dawkins . Your assertion presumes that you have read the works of both men . &quot;
Microevolution - Wikipedia , the free encyclopedia
Why is it when Creo &apos;s don &apos;t believe something , Evo &apos;s always think because they have studies or what have you that we Creo &apos;s have to accept it as proof . I mean you don &apos;t accept anything as proof from Creo &apos;s . If Creo &apos;s did some carbon testing and did it accurately and got some anomaly &apos;s , you &apos;d still reject it . I didn &apos;t lie not even by ignorance . I just don &apos;t believe it &apos;s true , but I take it I &apos;m not allowed my beliefs . What fact has disproved my worldview , my worldview is intact as it ever has been ?
You got it . People make mistakes . Finally you see that scientists are just as human as religious people .
Basic law 101 : You can drive by 15 1 / 2 with A LICENSED ADULT OVER 25 IN THE CAR . Not 18 or 21 , but 25 so it isn &apos;t a matter of potential peers watching each other . And your opening post referred to 14 year olds or above , as it shows below .
&quot; Why didn &apos;t they &quot; &quot; fire &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; bar &quot; &quot; him in the sixties ? &quot;
That is amazing . I find it crazy that this baby is much younger and smaller and far less developed than many of the babies that are aborted . Abortion is murder .
&quot; How do you know none of the &quot; &quot; children &quot; &quot; were actually gang members engaged in illegal activity , and that fact was simply excluded because it wasn &apos;t considered newsworthy ? &quot;
Rahm Emanuel for one . He seems to sum up the message very well . And then there &apos;s Carolyn McCarthy who actually introduced the bill that , if passed into law , would cancel your Second Amendment rights just because your name is on the no fly list . Just two names , perhaps , but they &apos;re the names of people in a very powerful and dangerous position , capable of making very bad things happen .
Yet this need for revenge is far removed from the need for justice . My original post addresses this feeling or need for the criminal to die . It has no relevance in the discussion of justice , only revenge .
Zoos are indeed a good example . Although the environments are made as close as possible to the natural habitats , penguins are often kept in open-air enclosures in temperate or even tropical climates . And there are two critical differences in even the most carefully constructed zoo : the absence of any predators , and the absence of any prey . So why don &apos;t the animals quickly / purposefully / nonrandomly cease exhibiting developmentally costly traits which give them an advantage against predators or prey who aren &apos;t present ?
&quot; In this case , I will present the Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection as evidence that life is evolving . As the evidence has been shown to support it , you are the person who should be presenting evidence . Currently , your assertion that organisms are &quot; &quot; devolving &quot; &quot; because of mutations has been shown to be faulty . &quot;
And you think this a good thing ? It just shows the weak cowardly position of the creationist .
But you think SETI is worthwhile !
Catholics have a different belief . The goal is to always save both mother and child . If the fetus dies during the attempt to save both , then that &apos;s what happens . For instance , with an ectopic pregnancy , the goal isn &apos;t to kill he fetus , the goal is to save both mother and fetus .
And that &apos;s when her career and popularity took a nosedive . Now that she &apos;s no longer playing the activist , she &apos;s becoming popular again .
Well , that just struck a chord with me . People of both sides say , “ We got the facts ! The facts support our side ! ” but it isn &apos;t about the facts but how we react to them .
It &apos;s not tough , especially for close stars. http : / / www.uwgb.edu / dutchs / CosmosNotes / distance.htm You use triangulation based on the orbit of the earth .
&quot; Actually it wasn &apos;t sitting somewhere since there was no &quot; &quot; where &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; sit &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; always &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; eternity &quot; &quot; have no meaning outside of time and no &quot; &quot; time &quot; &quot; existed prior to the &quot; &quot; Big Bang &quot; &quot; , maybe . &quot;
Who swings from Christmas cake to chrismas cake ? Tarzipan !
Actually there are already a couple floating around . One fascinating one : Gaia theory and the Daisyworld model . It &apos;s all around self-organising systems and the earth as a self-regulating system / organsism / something or other . James Lovelock and co . Interesting to read but sometimes feels a little too &apos; lets-all-just-get-along &apos; to be real , hard-core theory . Either way , it &apos;s probably a lot more likely to be accepted than creationism , should evolutionism for some reason be disproved .
Not knowing isn &apos;t the same as claiming magic .
&quot; Banning abortion is a tool with which to punish women you deem promiscuous or immoral and recreate through a police state a mythical golden age of christian virtue , got you . The rest is just a cover story in the same way biblical creationists who want their religion brought into the school system advocate &quot; &quot; intelligent design &quot; &quot; . They call it &quot; &quot; lying for baby Jesus &quot; &quot; . &quot;
LOL TOOO FUNNY
Only when it is anti-intellecutal relgion , such as those YEC &apos;s . Most relgiions are much more reasonable .
I think your idea has merit . However , before I would fully endorse it , I am interested in how you see it being implemented and administered from the standpoint of equal protection under the law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; The Civil War was fought to establish the principle that each person owns his own body - a principle that the pro-life crowd is trying to destroy . &quot; &quot; Each owns his own body ? Are you talking about the woman or the child in the womb ? &quot;
&quot; No , I &apos;m saying it &apos;s OK because abortion is legal in this country . I was just pointing out that it &apos;s also legal to execute a convicted killer , and it &apos;s fine and dandy to declare wars where many people will die . &quot; &quot; Thall shalt not kill , unless there is a war &quot; &quot; . Legally there is a difference . But let &apos;s just toss that out for a second . The end result is exactly the same . Eyes fogged over no longer care whether it was fun or self defense . It &apos;s only time it &apos;s your call , is when it &apos;s suicide . &quot;
http : / / www.talkorigins.org / indexcc / CD / CD011.html Radiocarbon dating has been repeatedly tested , demonstrating its accuracy . It is calibrated by tree-ring data , which gives a nearly exact calendar for more than 11,000 years back . It has also been tested on items for which the age is known through historical records , such as parts of the Dead Sea scrolls and some wood from an Egyptian tomb ( MNSU n.d. ; Watson 2001 ) . Multiple samples from a single object have been dated independently , yielding consistent results . Radiocarbon dating is also concordant with other dating techniques ( e.g. , Bard et al . 1990 ) .
OK try the US Constitution . We are a representative democratic republic not a majority rule nation . Majorities hold certain powers but they are limited . Minorities continue to have rights which may not be infringed by the majority . Amibiguity and sharing of interests in various types of personal and social decisions is a necessary component of this system . We are built on compromise and that has served us well .
Mother &apos;s choice at all times .
&quot; Since when were proteins no longer structures ? A basic freshmen tool for teaching is the phrase &quot; &quot; structure defines function . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fetal Homocide ? Toddler Homicide ? A human in different stages of development ..... Why / or What is the difference ? And if someone wanted this legal ( Toddler Homicide ) ... I don &apos;t see much anybody could do legally to stop it .. When women kill their tots they are locked up / and branded with a criminal record vs the female who callously kills durning the fetal stage . ( Double standard ? ) I have a couple friends , who have aborted more than once , because they didn &apos;t want to lose their girly figure ( trivial ) . I find it eerie and disturbion .....
No they don &apos;t . We didn &apos;t have a tyrannical society back in the 1830s when without a doubt personal autonomy didn &apos;t exist for some . The thing is , you don &apos;t have absolute personal autonomy now either . And it still doesn &apos;t answer my question about where the right came from , you just said there had to be one .
You are correct .
How many court decisions have said that it is unconstitutional to regulate guns in any way ?
Well let &apos;s put it this way . I really like playing baseball . So I put in a law that says everyone has to play baseball unless they &apos;re in a position where it will threaten their life . Since it &apos;s such a wonderful thing no one should have any problem with a law passed , right ?
You know , that sounds exactly what you are doing . I guess you are as foolish as they are .
the fetus would be a real person ... and it seems like .... in order to make the iraq war / abortion connection .... you would have to support the war !
thatisnt stupid , its what teh bible says. teh dinosaurs are heavier thatn humans so they sunk and humans foated. the arc protecid the rest ans they died later when humans kiled them tehy still see dinos today in congo so some survivd .
Just so you know Peach , the 167 death row inmates are now serving life in prison . At least that one who &apos;s not guilty might now have a chance to be free .
And yet quantum physics tends to be very contradictory , at least to our perceptions . Acausal events happen . A particle can be in two places at the same time . A particle can disappear and reappear in a different location without traversing that distance . And et cetera . Since the beginning of our local universe occurred at quantum levels , I would be cautious about drawing philosophical conclusions based on our macro-world experiences .
You know they are having a fit , and when everyone see &apos;s the streets aren &apos;t running red maybe more states will pick it up and follow .
&quot; I responded to your posts on the thread of &quot; &quot; Lets discuss the actual ... &quot; &quot; I suggest we continue that discussion there . &quot;
On what grounds do you seek to redefine the institution of marriage from it &apos;s accepted standard in this country ?
uh , yeah , that was their intent ! Under color of law no less . The truth always seems to be your worst enemy doesn &apos;t it ?
&quot; Well , to say it has no mental existence doesn &apos;t really tell the whole story . The fetus WILL have ( more than likely ) full mental existence in a very short time . It seems to me that if you &quot; &quot; view humanity with mental existance as important &quot; &quot; you &apos;d also view as important that the unborn baby WILL indeed reach that point , in all likelihood . &quot;
And sometimes , necessary .
&quot; This was pretty much my understanding of how natural selection was viewed before Darwin . Nonetheless , I think that my point still stands . Darwin proposed that natural selection is responsible for the diversification of species . This pre-Darwin concept denies this . My understanding is that anti-evolutionists refused to accept that natural selection could have led to the diversification of species . Until recently , when they realized that evolutionary theory could help out in their how-many-animals-could-fit-on-the-ark dilemma ; now they suddenly take an idea from evolutionary science and propose that suddenly all the present species could &quot; &quot; micro-evolve &quot; &quot; from a few ancestral &quot; &quot; kinds &quot; &quot; on the ark . &quot;
&quot; If logic was invented by man that would mean that when people did not exist neither did logic . That does not sound logical to me . Most people believe there is life eleswhere in the universe ( I &apos;m not saying I do but I just want to illustrate a point ) . If logic was invented by man does that mean aliens elsewhere in the universe do not have logic to guide them ? Just a question . &quot; &quot; In Christ are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge . &quot; &quot; ( Colossians 2 : 3 ) &quot;
&quot; The quality of life ethic is far different from sactity / dignity of life ethic . A quality of life ethic carried out to its logical conclusions does not promote a pro-life society . Instead , there would be genocide against the handicapped , elderly , and people who people of power have deemed life unworthy of life . The problem with this ethic is that it is centered in arbritrary people deciding arbritarily which person passes the &quot; &quot; quality of life &quot; &quot; test . &quot;
Said the troll that lives in the UK
Congratulations . You are now part of a minority group . Marriage tends to either work or it doesn &apos;t . I know , brilliant observation . What I mean is either the couple is together for decades or spend x amount of years being unhappy until the unhappy is more than the baggage of divorce .
Hmmm ... so , barren women can not have a valid point of view nor women in the stage of menopause because it does not affect them personally . Perhaps you should tell the moderator to institute women only Forums , men only Forums , gays only Forums … . etc
Well , thank you for this thread Santafeur . I must say though that I peruse various threads just to read stuff . The C vs. E topic does not strike a nerve with me . In fact , I also wonder what it is about the human mind that makes people so desperate to want to know how we came about . What difference does it make ? We are here now . Could we possibly just accept that we got here somehow , and just move on ?
But then , there also is absolutely no evidence for such an intelligence .
I don &apos;t see how one can be a agnostic and be a Deist either . Deism requires a origin , some form of a clockmaker . To not be sure that such a being exists is to fail one of the most basic ideas of Deism .
Oh I hated being pregnant . However I am not really arguing whether pregnancy in and of itself is punishment , I suspect that is an opinion matter - there are some crazy women who actually liked pregnancy . Julie - however clearly feels that it is acceptable to use a pregnancy and parenting in a punitive matter against women she feels are irresponsible .
Again , it &apos;s not just &apos; evidence &apos; but &apos; evidence constructed into a workable theory &apos; .
Except it &apos;s not . It &apos;s perfectly acceptable to morally disagree with drinking and smoking ( and encourage others not to do it ) and still believe others should have the freedom to choose for themselves. chloe ,
&quot; So indignities offered our citizens will be tolerated if dispensed in small doses ? Maybe we might educate the pirates what they should &quot; &quot; know better &quot; &quot; than to try . My taxes pay to have a Navy presence around the world . Americans are American interests . &quot;
You know Brady , you &apos;ve said a lot of stupid stuff over the years . I even remember finding a post of yours where you said all guns and gun owners should be registered , but sex offenders shouldn &apos;t be . This latest post of yours is just another senseless and stupid rambling of somebody that &apos;s so hateful and fearful of an inanimate object that it &apos;s impossible for him to function in our society and can barely handle his own needs .
Yes . Oddly , the picture makes as much sense as most creationists .
And she was having unprotected sex ? So she knew becoming pregnant was a possibility ? Yeah , I could see that being condemned by pro-lifers .
Oh , he doesn &apos;t want abortion , huh ? If you take the Old Testament to be true , you just lied here . Let &apos;s look , shall we ?
Why do people on the pro-gun side continuously try to oversimplify the issue ? No one is really arguing that there would be zero murder without guns . The question is would there be less murders without guns . In developed nations with stricter gun laws there are less murders . At any rate , I don &apos;t think you can draw such conclusions based on one incident .
And where , pray tell are you pulling THIS strawman from ?
This claim might be true , but do you have any citations about Carl Burgh &apos;s fraudulent claims ? ( ps I note you don &apos;t tell everyone else to go look up a book ! It &apos;s nice to feel special ) I know of this site http : / / home.austarnet.com.au / stear / carl _ baugh _ page.htm which makes the claim , but I &apos;d be interested to learn more about this alleged fraud
I &apos;m afraid you &apos;re wrong , as I created you in my universe , and implanted in you a belief that you were a god . It lead you to make statements about the truth of your own beliefs , which I &apos;m afraid are just self-beliefs with no real evidence . Sorry .
This whole thing is simply an epistemological argument , for which there is no answer . What is the nature of knowledge ? There are positivists ( Abe here ) and there are constructivists ( what Abe says you have to be if you don &apos;t believe in god . ) This is a metaphysical debate that is decades old and it simply depends upon your point of view for the purpose of the discussion at hand .
And I would like to know why that is . I asked the question in post # 2 and got no answer . Are laypersons lacking in intelligence so much that it &apos;s hopeless for them to be on the same communication level with scientists ? Since they share the same society , put their pants on one leg at a time in the same way , eat , sleep , and share economic processes in comparable ways , it seems to me it would be beneficial for them and laypersons both to understand each other when they use identical terms . ( like the word , “ theory ” )
Argueing with penfold is like wrestling a pig in the mud , the pig enjoys it .
And you still have provided no evidence .
A taste of what could be our future if the left has its way .
Or perhaps Mach just doesn &apos;t understand the concept of an &apos; analogy . &apos; No one was claiming they want &apos; rights restricted &apos; because of of bathrooms . He &apos;s either being beligerent by intentionally portraying the analogy as a premise , or incredibly dense . I &apos;m starting to wonder if it &apos;s the latter . . . .
You can not create the general from the specific , only the specific from the general
What does a mutation have to do with a heart transplant ? What are you smoking ?
&quot; It is clearly not a strawman argument . I think he doesn &apos;t know what &quot; &quot; straw man &quot; &quot; means and I think he is meaning to say &quot; &quot; red herring . &quot; &quot; It isn &apos;t a red herring either ; it &apos;s a perfectly logically related question . I would guess he doesn &apos;t see that as he neither understands evolution nor bacterial resistance and , thus , the relationship . &quot;
&quot; Well , ya know , if you actually , oh I don &apos;t know , VISITED THE SITE , you &apos;d see that the &quot; &quot; friendlyatheist.com &quot; &quot; is a blog-like page ( and not the one that is actually giving the info on the evolutionary migration of humanity ) and it gave a link to the actual website that we are talking about ( the second link I gave ) : http : / / www.bradshawfoundation.com / journey / But then , maybe we &apos;re expecting a little too much from a creationist . &quot;
No but the fact that infants have brain activity makes them a world of difference between a zygote that has no brain activity . They can think and feel and exhibit all the characteristics of other human beings . A zygote exhibits none of those characteristics .
&quot; Well , by the strict defintion of the word &quot; &quot; born &quot; &quot; , an abortion is considered a premature birth . &quot;
Where were the French on D-Day and the Normandy Invasion when Hitler was burglering their Nation ? I don &apos;t recall history mentioning a Frenchman around but the Americans were saving their rears once again ...
&quot; I see a subtle distinction here . Creationism is concerned with the spiritual origins of people . &quot; &quot; Evolutionism &quot; &quot; is entirely concerned with explaining the nature and history of the physical world . The conflict of opinion arises out of the importance of the detail- can Genesis be accepted as a parable which contains a fundemental truth or must it be taken as a historical account ? &quot;
&quot; No , it is not a bad deal for the child . However , my beliefs do not permit murder , even if it is a better &quot; &quot; deal &quot; &quot; . &quot;
&quot; Well it could mean simple instinct , and I think you will find it was only applied to animals with brains . EAM attributes &quot; &quot; intelligence &quot; &quot; even to bacteria and to corn plants , trees , jellyfish , single celled eukaryotes etc . If one is to consider intelligence the main driver of adaptation it must be omnipresent in living organisms - there is zero support for this concept . &quot;
Actually there is a better solution . Mandatory male and female birth control pills , financial penalties if you stop taking . Anyone who would get off the pill would want a kid , therefore , abortions would cease .
&quot; So what &apos;s the deal when GWB &quot; &quot; gives &quot; &quot; $ 3,000 but the insurance premiums cost $ 6,000 , the family can &apos;t make up the difference and the $ 3,000 goes unspent . All we &apos;ve accomplished is to transfer $ out of the U.S. Treasury . You think it &apos;s a good idea to just give money away and not get anything for it ? You &apos;re thinking of the Clinton years when there was a surplus . &quot;
&quot; Somehow I don &apos;t think a high percentage of Ham &apos;s &quot; &quot; facts &quot; &quot; are facts . &quot;
So then the law is flawed because criminals could just as easily get their hands on select firearms , ban or no ban . You &apos;ve just admitted that the bill did nothing and thus there &apos;s no justification for it to be reinstated .
Actually , no , that is not what I said . I said : What you quoted is what Answers in Genesis said . Please do not be dishonest and tell others that I said this as I did not .
Good old monkeys ! What can &apos;t we learn from them Since we are in the Creation vs Evolution section I &apos;m guessing that your debate here is that monkeys and humans show some similar ways of thinking such as in this experiment . It does seem like further evidence that evolution did take place between our two species although it isn &apos;t a case cracker by any means .
So it &apos;s the blog &apos;s fault that Miller sided with the creationists . Right-o , marc . ( I suspect you haven &apos;t even read the blog entry in question ; I &apos;d be surprised if you &apos;ve read more than a paragraph of PZ &apos;s blog .. ever . )
I know it &apos;s almost as silly as thinking gay marriage will undermine heterosexual marriage .
Notice the double-standard here ? The homosexual lobby accuses us of harassment , yet they are willing to provide names and addresses of people who oppose their agenda . I can &apos;t wait to see the backlash from this one .
I wouldn &apos;t say most cjurches , because you cannot prove that . There is a long list of churches that are accepting of gay folks .
Holy grail implies it is like a religion , which it is not . If evidence is found that overturns this theory , it will be discarded in favour of a better one .
Actually you &apos;re wrong . Actually you &apos;re very , very wrong . The 5th Amendment , and all the other amendments in the Bill of Rights , only provide protections against government interference , not interference from your neighbors and people who don &apos;t have governmental jobs . But just for the sake of argument , if you want to argue how the man &apos;s rights were violated , how about we discuss the rights of the woman ? Doesn &apos;t she have a right to not be raped ? Doesn &apos;t she have a right to be secure in her own home against forced invasion ?
And he accomplished all this human carnage without a gun . This just proves that if it was possible to eliminate all projectile firing weapons from existing on earth , men would find a way to commit atrocities against his own kind just as he did before such weapons existed if murder was in his heart . Guns are not the issue , the corrupted heart / nature of humanity is .
After what the Fins been through , fighting the mother country , the Soviet Union under Lenin and then Russia and Germany and finally Germany , I doubt they are going to let their own government take away their guns ? ? Most folks have learned to leave those Finns alone .
I don &apos;t have the time nor the funding to put this in video form like Harris and Dawkins . I don &apos;t think many , if any , Christians really do - satire about atheism isn &apos;t a strong Christian practice , not nearly as strong as atheist satire about Christianity , it seems . Maybe that &apos;s what made Poe &apos;s Law so notable in the beginning of this thread .
so do we trash the whole thing , or what ?
Actually , not at all true . The organisms of the Cambrian look little like modern animals . It is only the major phyla that are recognized by the derived characteristics . For example , the cordates first arise in the early Cambrian , along with primitive inverebrates . You can safely say that no animal living today looks much like any living then . For example , there were no amphibians , no reptiles , no insects , no birds , and of course , no mammals . Your shotgun approach isn &apos;t actually worth answering in any detail . It isn &apos;t even your work .
&quot; No , I think that he &apos;s right on target . The drug dealers that are caught here in Michigan usually get caught with weed AND more hardcore drugs . Theyy &apos;re &quot; &quot; full service &quot; &quot; dealers . Weed is a gateway drug , you know . &quot;
But wouldn &apos;t it make it more likely that a gun dealer that was involved in gun trafficking would be audited and caught by the ATF ? If there are less FFLs then the ATF has more time to monitor and inspect each gun dealer .
Just to contribute , I &apos;m pro-gun , have had training in the proper use and laws in my area , and have owned weapons for more than 30 years .
A slimey claim you cannot support as usual . In developed Nations , the U.S. is far down the list as has been posted on this very board at least 5 times . Those &apos; other &apos; Nations also have far more crime and violent crime than the U.S.
I think if Islamic fundamentalism shows us nothing else it &apos;s that ...
But I already pointed out the mark of Cain in another thread. http : / / www.4forums.com / political / sho ... 57 &amp; amp ; postcount = 1 You see , this particular gene has but two alleles . One exists in the majority of humans . That allele , along with several other genes involved in pigmentation create people with various shades of brown to very brown skin . The second allele was created by a more recent mutation and spread in a more limited population . That allele produces white skin .
&quot; Well said . With this religion , the gap is very wide between the &quot; &quot; average guy &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; authority &quot; &quot; , because their clergy is more involved in politics than the clergy of Christianity , or the Creator himself . It fits with more Democrats being evolutionists , and more Democrats favoring bigger domestic government . &quot;
So what we have here is a lie , based on a distortion , which is itself a fallback position from a fallback position from a fallback position from an evidence-free made-up graph about the magnetic age of the earth . And creationists say the truth is constant ...
Iangb , I would have thought that you would be intellectually honest enough to have ( at least ) accepted the fact that I have supported my claims . I also thought that ( by now ) someone from your side of the abortion issue would step in ( in this thread or by private message ) and hold you to your claims of being &apos; intellectually honest . &apos; At this point , I actually have you questioning Planned Parenthood &apos;s definitions ? QUOTE ;
&quot; Then should not your challenge be re-worded to say &quot; &quot; What might be the best ... &quot; &quot; Because at present we are not at a stage where by we know everything about &apos; pain &apos; therefore in the current climate , rather than what might be known down the track , I think I have met the majority of your challenge . After-all , you are insisting now on what &apos; you can measure &apos; , and we can &apos;t measure all that there is about pain , at present . &quot;
Not if they give him the death penalty , then it &apos;s apeals till your ears bleed .
The thing is , Bush didn &apos;t live in Canada .
It &apos;s possible that Archaeopteryx is not a direct descendant of modern birds but it &apos;s certainly not far from the line and it shares both avian and therepodian characteristics .
And my interpretation of my writing is that I didn &apos;t mean that . Who has more authority ?
yeah , this is clearly the best thread on these forums in probably the past year .... give us some more pics
And that didn &apos;t have a thing to do with my point .
I &apos;m not aware that the police used violence in arresting any of the people discussed in this case . Besides , I &apos;m not discussing personal morality here , I &apos;m discussing what should be legal , and what is practical in a society where not everyone shares the same moral views . Government is there to apply limits to what is permitted , based on the will of the people .
http : / / www.dcagenda.com / 2010 / 02 / 08 / m ... asure-in-poll / Keep in mind that this is an opinion poll , so take it for what its worth , but it seems to indicate that the people of DC wanted to vote on this issue .
And i dont really believe in god because he has shown us NO compelling evidence of his existance .
If atheism is a religion , than yes and atheism . If it &apos;s not then no . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
23,000 firearms were handed in when the UK had its gun ban . According to your logic those people that handed in their firearms can still be prosecuted because they took possession of a firearm prior to the ban . I don &apos;t think so .
Do you want something other than peppered moths , bacteria developing resistance to antibiotics , Darwin &apos;s finches , and the other species of the Galapagos ? Maybe biologists are not allowed to do tests on animals that will kill many of them . This reminds me of Kent Hovind &apos;s reward for evidence of evolution : impossible to fulfill .
But the point is why are there relatively few creationists . The reason is that the creationist position cannot be defended in open debate . That is why creationist boards censor opposing views . On boards where creationists are not protected there are few .
&quot; And for those who are not deadbeats ? Would you grant them any &quot; &quot; rights ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Exactly . It is their fault , but they can do what they choose . It is punishment and you know it , and it is not your job to make sure no &quot; &quot; irresponsible &quot; &quot; pregnant woman goes unpunished . &quot;
Just some interesting information I learned when we went caving a couple years ago ( a real cave , not one of the commercialized ones ) . Bats actually have better eyesite than humans , but even they can &apos;t see in pitch black . No eye can .
maybe , but see , that does not match the materialist universe ?
Humm . More guns , more Concealed Carry and Violent Crime and Murder is down to it &apos;s lowest levels since they started to record it . So how can these studies be credible or considered in anyway correct .
What &apos;s your point ? Of course they will be bound by Heller just as the courts are bound by Roe v. Wade . That point wasn &apos;t in dispute . As long as you &apos;re talking about 19th Century Second Amendment case law , I like The State v. Buzzard ( 1842 ) .
And how does this compare to your ideas on artificial selection ?
Well , I would agree that as many constitutional ammendments probably would not have passed , but I certainly don &apos;t think they all would not have been passed , and I don &apos;t think that Massachusettes allowing same-sex marriage was a bad thing . Constitutional ammendments are difficult to overcome , but no one can ever change a law if people aren &apos;t willing to take a stand and fight for it . Can you tell that I love the quote in Jyoshu &apos;s signature ?
But ... but ... I just swallowed 56 zygotes so that they could vote by proxy through me for the Ripofflican ( tm ) party this upcoming election so they can win . Now I &apos;m going to have all that indigestion for nothin &apos; . As to driving ... don &apos;t care . What I &apos;ll miss most is all of those credit card offers that come in their names . There &apos;s just so much that they , living though me want to &apos; buy now and pay later &apos; on . You saying they can &apos;t do that ?
I think that the type of weapon does make a difference . A tyrant would be more dangerous to the world if he was armed with WMDs rather than knives .
To the extent that working toward social change on any moralistic issue is an &apos; imposition &apos; , sure . But I think one could say that about anything that has a social effect .
Because I don &apos;t feel like copying and pasting articles into a forum when they can be easily accessed online . But for a quick summary : The CCR-5 gene mutation is present in about 15 % of caucasians , with 1 % having the homogeneous version . These 1 % are completely immune . The heterogeneous people possess some immunity .
No , that &apos;s just the pork tacked onto the original bill .
Fossils are evidence , not theory . They can be used in the construction of any theory , including creationism . Whether this is &apos; just &apos; or not , is another issue . I point this out as many seem confused about evidence , and think that it just points to something without interpretation
Really , with C being between 1 / 2 and 2 million defensive gun uses per year . Or perhaps the hundreds of millions of legal , non-defense related , gun uses per year . When you compare the number times a guns are used legally to the number of times they are used illegally , B becomes pretty insignificant .
You think open carrying of loaded handguns in public will become fashionable in CA ? I think if anyone took to this they &apos;d find themselves asked to leave establishments routinely .
How curious that not everyone can admit that this kind of treatment is wrong . How interesting that another issue comes up instead of addressing the blatant , in-your-face kind of mistreatment of an individual making a private , personal decision . Like many decisions in life , this is one that is difficult to come to . It doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s a wrong one . It &apos;s hard because your options are so very serious .
Actually I think most people DO realize this .
No Steve , I realise that there are hetersexuals who practice that filthy pastime of anal sex and other sex acts that the human body is not designed to do . Heterosexuals have no more business doing these things then homosexuals . Do you realise Steve that E Coli bacteria inhabit the rectum and are in feces ? Do you know how sick and E Coli infection can make you ? Sodomy is akin to having sex in raw sewage .
Oh I can easily spend $ 1,000 dollars an hour . If I could I would also have plenty of reason to live to be 114 .
Can &apos;t your religion survive a little mockery ? On the other hand I can understand why your worried your religion being so ridiculous and all .
* * Actually it provided proof that RMNS doesn &apos;t explain the development of hands and feet , but I don &apos;t expect you to be able to understand that .
Interesting , but it appears to ignore the fact that there is pre-existing variation ( just look at the pictures ) . Emphasizing mutations is ok , but relying solely on them will probably skew results .
Notice that even in this version there are elipses just before the quote in question . My bet is if we were to actually refer to this 44 years old book , Simpson would not be saying what Toxey wants him to say .
LOL ! If my post was about either of those things , I would cut it down . The vast majority of the post , however , is about the objections to irreducible complexity .
And it also took an amendment to give the slaves rights , not a judge .
&quot; They aren &apos;t afraid of that . That a government agency would actually be financially competitive is ridiculous . The only way it could compete for customers would be by running at an enormous loss or legislating away competition . That &apos;s what people are &quot; &quot; afraid &quot; &quot; of , not some idiotic speculation that government is great at business . &quot;
Evolutionary scientists is a confusing term . A geochronologist might work out an age for a lava sample for example . Astronomers have also made comment on the age of the earth as have paleontologists studying certain fossils . So why would no flood make radiometric much more likely to accurate as you say ? Can we hear some specific detail on this as it is kinda significant to backing you your assumption .
Either a gross misunderstanding or a gross misrepresentation of evolutionary theory .
You could put the stranger out even if they had nowhere to go and it was freezing cold out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; In Christ there is neither Jew nor Greek , slave nor free , male nor female , all are one in Christ Jesus &quot; &quot; - Galatians 3 : 28 Jesus doesn &apos;t care whether you &apos;re male or female . &quot;
Then you are just throwing around words without knowing what they mean . Instead you give me a link to a page of pseudoscience . Are those the ones who lied to you ?
That was a nice rant that had absolutely nothing to do with anything . The essential question is not what various religous leaders have said about the issue , but what the Bible says about the issue .
Actually , I meant the behaviour refered to in her post was interesting .
I think that case was in Georgia ( a different state ) and so far as I know homosexuality was not involved . However if you want to worry about a legal case you need to look at Dover Pa . Not the sticker case in Cobb County .
Actually , it &apos;s not conjecture . The genetic makeup of the several subspecies of arctic foxes bear it out . The dominant allele is rare because it is less adaptive . The dominant allele is most likely ancestral . But even foxes below the Arctic circle show differences in their fur between summer and winter . So yes , foxes that were able to change color in the north had a differential reproductive advantage over those who couldn &apos;t .
&quot; Please define &quot; &quot; climb upward &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; downhill slide &quot; &quot; in biologically meaningful terms . Please define &quot; &quot; degeneration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Some ? 90 % is more than some in my opinion . That is a horrible waste . Just think if we could retain 50 % of the energy we consumed . We could start eating 1 / 5th of what we normally eat .
So now Wiesmann &apos;s barrier is the most important thing to the ToE ? Somehow I doubt that biologists agree , but obviously creationists have more authority on the topic of evolution ...
Because there are people who are trying to deny the theory of evolution it &apos;s place as a vital part of public school &apos;s biology curriculum .
True , but what i was trying to state is that the bible has little to do with christianity if you dont believe in it . I know many christians who believe in god , and jesus etc , but think the bible is completely false , and is only a book of fables . Thats what i was trying to imply .
According to Gallup about 8 % of the U.S. population is atheist . Another poll by CUNY found that 7.7 % of those polled responded that they had no religion .
No , but in some cultures they mutilate them for meaningless tradition .
&quot; You are free to disagree with the article , Chemist99a , but it was written by a scientist . You are quite free to believe biological complexity is the result of &quot; &quot; natural selection &quot; &quot; somehow organizing a bunch of genetic accidents into complex biological systems . I suspect you will become increasingly unable to impose that view upon everyone else . Questions about Materialismwith some pretty funny stuff about Freud . &quot;
Why are you dishonest enough to claim that you aren &apos;t trying to get YEC into the schools .
Speaking of which , did you happen to see this image that someone kindly forwarded to me ? http : / / iowntheworld.com / blog / wp-cont ... iew-lo-res.jpg
But poetry will never be taken seriously in political decisions . Atheists have a lot to like in songofgenesis , don &apos;t they ? another quote
I &apos;m not saying we got it all right
the blog is just the link for the article .... geez , get a grip .
&quot; So what standards of proof do you hold the bible to ? What allows you to hold it next to other religious or fantastical texts and say &quot; &quot; Yes , this one is definately , without fail , the word of God , and this one is not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
An attempt by you to dodge the main point .
&quot; Certainly science has provided part of the answer with their finding of the Mitachondrial &quot; &quot; Eve &quot; &quot; , suggesting that one person can have all the DNA necessary for all the variation in human populations . One of the standard rebuttals you hear is &quot; &quot; How did the Kangaroos get to Australia &quot; &quot; ? I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s covered in the Bible ... if God transported them or not . &quot;
The question still remains as to whether this is negative intrusion ( which is what the libertarians want ) or positive intrusion ( what the libertarians do not want . ) Anyone with half a brain can know that it &apos;s intrusion . The matter becomes complicated when one tries to place it in the category of anti-murder laws or theocratic forced religion laws .
Honestly I &apos;m not sure if it was ever said in the Bible , but I sure have heard a lot of the Bible thumpers saying free will is a gift from God .
Are you sure ? Use your google .
So you &apos;re saying that the theory of evolution is similar to # # # # , in that they both make large messes when they come into contact with fans ?
&apos;IF &apos; is the question . It suggests that Holy Tradition does not know the answer . Secondly , the issue of the flood itself could still be true and tested scientifically ... as to whether an historical Noah existed that you might consign to &apos; myth &apos; . Does anyone here not find it interesting that there is almost a universal factor in societies concerning a global flood ? PS I have already discussed M-Eve on another post .
Old news . There have been accusations of similar stories for years .
Yea that was uncle John !
We agree ! Excellent !
You only say that it won &apos;t make a change because you support the effects it will have .
Because self-defence , unlike most other &apos; reasons &apos; , automatically allows all citizens firearm access , and in most cases allows firearm acess without mandatory training / evaluation . When this occurs , you are much more likely to get misuse of firearms . If you read around you &apos;ll see that I consider all rights as needing justification . This comes both from my stance as a relativist and as a UK citizen , where there is no formalised Constitution . Ask yourself this - if a right cannot be justified , why should it be treated as a &apos; right &apos; ?
I had researched some stuff about viruses that was applicable about life in general because it is the only thing that is not defintely classified . So the argument was about life , the other stuff was just peripheral . Don &apos;t make such a big deal about including other tings in it .
think about what you just typed , that doesn &apos;t make any sense .
Do me a favor . Write , in your own words , two paragraphs . One explaining the electromagnetic spectrum ( and the visible spectrum &apos;s place in it ) , and one discussing rods and cones in the eyes .
Who &apos;s this directed at ? Me or Ray ?
The question is illogical . By declaring the existence of an all powerful God then saying God cannot do something is not a comment on his powerfulness but rather the direct representation of his nature . Your question by its very statement does not test wether or not God is all powerful but wether or not God is comprehensible . See another thread for that topic . The statement that God is all powerful defines his nature . To state then that he cannot do something outside of his nature as proof of the non existence of his nature is circular in logic .
But it has never been claimed that everything developet simultaneously . Probably not . So back to the original question that you ducked with ad hoc arguments . What is Archaeopteryx . If it is a bird , why does it have a tail , grastalia , teeth , pre-orbital fenestra , and on and on . If it isn &apos;t a bird then why does it have feathers , opposable hallux , pneumatic bones , a furcula , and even a small carina in one specimen ? How can creationism explain Archaeopteryx ? http : / / home.houston.rr.com / bybayouu / ... graphica _ 1.jpg
If that &apos;s truly what the organization says , then it &apos;s a hypocrite of an organization .
Isn &apos;t agreeing with what ? The senate hasn &apos;t passed any laws that would restrict right to carry anymore than it already is .
&quot; Right . It was thrown out of schools back in the 1960s , and again in the 1980s when attempts were made to dress creationism up in the jargon of science and call it &quot; &quot; Creation science . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m not sure that your comment will encourage any sort of discussion . Certainly no one is glad because your mother died so young . Not even creationists are likely to be gleeful .
Again , this wasn &apos;t just about you and me . I do think you corrected someone &apos;s spelling and if you didn &apos;t it was another creationist .
Actually , that story was an invention after the fact . It never happened . At least that is what the witnesses who were there said . Why do christians feel that it is OK to invent such stories to support their point ? Isn &apos;t that lying ? Isn &apos;t lying wrong ?
you know why ? because God touches our hearts like nothing you have ever felt before. it is amazing
And they have been found in volume buried together in the same strata in Ohio also . Vertebrate Fossils - Ohio History Central - A product of the Ohio Historical Society
It is worse then that they just don &apos;t get it . Once you put some civil rights on the ballot nothing is off limits . Freedom of speech , religion , assembly ect .. they are all up to be voted out of existence for an unpopular minority by the majority . They just don &apos;t get it .
You believe two things that are incorrect : that you have refuted evolutionary theory , and that we will now accept intellegent design because of your attempt .
The Brady Campaign whines more than they act . Making handguns legal in Chicago wouldn &apos;t make them happy . Sending the national guard in wouldn &apos;t make them happy . They don &apos;t have a solution for the problem , but they &apos;re right there to whine about it . They &apos;re just like the Federal Government ; they find something simple and complicate it .
So what ? If somebody wants to die then they &apos;ll kill themselves no matter what .
Well I # # # # , moan , and bitch about it to and I know I can &apos;t prove anything , but do &apos;nt logic say an AK47 ASSAULT RIFLE not semi auto but the real deal is going to cost hundreds less south of their border , Know doubt the same for an M16.Also you don &apos;t have to worry about smuggling them in as much if at all.Besides it getting harder all the time to get your ASSAULT RIFLES ( you know the full auto type ) not to mention hand grenades and rpgs at your corner gun shop anymore.Oh yeah less not forget the gun shows , and all there loop holes . Jus a thought .
OH ? What U.S. Code governs that ? What does it say ?
&quot; He had ALREADY MADE the animals . &quot; &quot; now the Lord God HAD FORMED ... &quot; &quot; not &quot; &quot; now the Lord God formed ... &quot; &quot; See the difference ? He already HAD FORMED the animals before he brought them to Adam . He made the animals before Adam . &quot;
Two things , Symbiote 1 ) what is the objective basis of rights that makes it different from other value judgements of the majority ? 2 ) when two rights come into conflict , is the result always simple inaction ? 3 ) is the importance of rights greater than democracy ? Or is democracy a right ? If the latter , how does this work with ( 2 ) ? 4 ) how do you react to the fact that in the sorts of cases I mention the results of a rights system is clearly bad for individual people ?
logic would lead one to believe abortion is wrong ... but why be consistent in your thinking . The point is , logic and rational thinking is not a requirement to make a law . You can ban abortion is you want ... the states did it and the constitution allows it , even if 5 legislatures think otherwise .
I think you are the same person as usa all the way and again .. you have no right to talk about murder because you murder the english language everytime you post . And no .. the baby does not belong to god because there is no baby and I don &apos;t know if there is a god or not . Btw .. I &apos;m not going to incubate something in my body because of you think it &apos;s wrong because someone who may or may not exist said so .
* * Nor do I think you at all stupid . I do not debate stupid people , there is no challenge in it . Nor do I debate arrant foolishness and irrational notions such as biblical literalism . It &apos;s no more challenging than shooting fish in a barrel , and no more satisfying than destroying a child &apos;s faith in the tooth fairy . But I do take offence at you characterizing my ability to reason logically and to think with some originality as being nothing more than &apos; manipulation &apos; and sophistry .
I &apos;m not . ---
So every woman who has an abortion lives an irresponsible life . Care to give any examples , or are you just spouting rubbish with no experience or knowledge whatsoever ?
Should free speech require registration ?
Actually , the storm lasted for 40 days and 40 nights . The ark was actually afloat for a year or so . So I guess the answer is that the ark had all kinds of pestilent insects winging about and biting and stinging the occupants . The problem is , how did these aquatic breeders actually propagate in the feces and urine infested bilge of the ark ?
So the founding fathers and their work is basicy viewed as an authority based on their competence ?
In point of fact , the low birth rate in most of Europe is not due to the availablity of abortion , but to good sex education and the ready availablity of effective contraception to everyone who needs it . See this study , for instance : http : / / www.advocatesforyouth.org / PUB ... heet / fsest.htm People have small families because they want small families . In point of fact , the abortion rate in Europe is generally much lower than the rate in the US , due , again , to education and contraception . Would you force folks to have children they don &apos;t want ?
Can &apos;t argue with this illogic .
Don &apos;t you think this would fit the &apos; Creationism is nothing but lie &apos;s thread a bit better ? Although I notice The Skeptic making disparaging remarks about your examples , it seems he attacks you more than deal with the well documented examples you have .
I know that . I asked those questions to show how dumb and ridiculous unkerpaulies question was - took it to other examples where such a question is obviously ridiculous to illustrate the ridiculousness of his question .
Because quite simply , it is all what we observe . One has never observed a mutation that has been seen to increase the information in the genome . If there have been any mutations that have led to an increase in information , please state it .
But you can &apos;t . You may imagine it but you can &apos;t present evidence that supports your position . You can only argue against what you don &apos;t understand in the first place . I generally make it a rule to keep my mouth shut unless I have actually had the integrity to educate myself about the basics of a topic . You don &apos;t seem to do the same .
Yes , but we had no way to tell until we found them again , now had we ?
Well , kind of a boring thread , since everyone agrees , but since I &apos;m new here , I may as well weigh in . Hubby and I have three grown kids and one teen . The grown ones all got the same going-to-college gifts . They got a safe car , a laptop , an emergency credit card , and a personal firearm . I felt this especially important for our daughters .
&quot; You know , I would be fine with that as long as it were truly a middle ground . If that term were used equally among straights as well as gays . But it &apos;s just a term . The same as with the term &quot; &quot; marriage . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s just a term . Just a word . Personally I feel the government needs to get out of the business of marriage altogether . Let the legal term be agreed upon unilaterally . &quot;
Oh , so you were not in any way talking about evolution in these posts ? Then why are they posted on the c vs e board ? Please , that &apos;s just pathetic .
Actually , Peeling and others on this thread have proven you and Cash to be utterly wrong . The fact you don &apos;t recognize this is irrelevant .
You know , I cannot even remember if we covered it in middle school or high school biology . I do remember learning about Mendel and his genetics , but I swear I can &apos;t remember if we even mentioned Darwin &apos;s name . If we spent any time on it at all , it was very little . Our biology classes were mostly devoted to taxonomy , anatomy / physiology , and cellular machinery .
I never said anything about a conspiracy Peeling . I very clearly gave valid reasons to Consider that scientific GRANTS and pay increases for these scientists are based on making new and previously undiscovered claims that forward the science . That is the greatest motivation to lie , cheat , create and falsify evidence which adds to the scientists personal wealth and further promotes a false science that is rife with selfish motivations to preserve , protect and promote it .
Exactly . It seems that anyone can dream up hypotheses in evolutionary psychology . Here &apos;s what Coyne said :
&quot; Well , here &apos;s another quote from Allan Feduucia : &quot; &quot; Feathers are unique to birds , and no known structure intermediate between scales and feathers has been identified . &quot; &quot; ( J. Alan Feduccia , The Age of Birds , Harvard University Press , 1980 , pg . 52 ) Sounds contradictory to me ! &quot;
&quot; This joke is based on some reality , &quot; &quot; the conquest of the North Pole is traditionally credited to Anglo-American Navy engineer Robert Edwin Peary , who claimed to have reached the Pole on April 6 , 1909 . Anyhow , not all jokes are completely true , how many stand up comedians have you heard ? ? ? If you were to nit pick every joke out there ( being politicaly correct etc ) there would be no jokes left ! &quot;
Not entirely true . While we can &apos;t disprove that God created the universe , we can disprove many creationist claims . For example , we can disprove that the earth is 6000 years old .
And many of those countries are having problems with it . Furthermore , we aren &apos;t even proposing what other countries have .
If the fetus is human is not relevant ? So if everyone says it is human then it still doesn &apos;t have a right to live then huh ? Do you really support the killing of an innocent life for whatever reason ? Do you really think placing one human over another is good ( in this case women is more important then baby ) ?
This also applies to tapeworms . I fail to see how it is therefore relevent to any debate on abortion .
But if the repeated tests just confirm the same errors or misinterpretations of the results , all of the independent reviews in the World wont make a difference .
Because their properties are contradictory .
Certainly , because with calm empathy you can casually address such a matter simply because the struggle does not pertain to you personally . To be able to put into question the love of another human being is simply not only alarming in nature , but damning to the very definition of love , equality , and freedom in creation of man .... And to trump this as a question of morality only serves as a mask to curtail the prejudice objections one personally has to a ceremony , right , and relationship that person will not even be personally affected by ....
Well now , there you go . . . .RIGHT ON ! !
&quot; Three questions : What country operates under an &quot; &quot; unbridled capitalism &quot; &quot; system ? Can you name any nation that has operated under your idea of socialism successfully ? If the American system of government is so terrible , why do we have one of the highest standards of living on earth ? Just because you think you are entitled to what I earn doesn &apos;t make it so . Earn your own . &quot;
That &apos;s a bad term . I wouldn &apos;t call myself that , but I do know more then average person .
Why would they be useless ? They aren &apos;t useless on birds ? And how is this qustion different in any meaningful way from the above ? Aren &apos;t wings forelimbs with feathers ? It seems that soaring or gliding or even faster running would be extremely useful .
Yes , it is human , biologically . However , it isn &apos;t a human being as it isn &apos;t alive .
Tell this to those infants and adults in the netherlands who are being euthanized against their will. this is a logical conclusion of a quality of life ethic without a sanctity of life basis .
Believe me , marc , we certainly can . The fact that it damns your argument is no skin off our backs . In fact , it damns your argument so much that the producers know it . See below .
&quot; Define &quot; &quot; many &quot; &quot; . What you really mean one is too much . Even when the one is used soles for personal defense . Besides your in Austraila , no one cares what you think . &quot;
Well , if you breed them , you could get taller monkeys with less hair ( and other humanlike characteristics ) . Even so , it would take a long time .
Generally , when someone posts an article without a disclaimer , they agree with the findings and the reasoning of the article provided . Besides , your statement does not change the fact that the reasoning provided is foolish .
And what does Marc do ? Try to change the subject .
The curriculum is legal outside the public school system , and used in private schools . ( I left a couple of sample links on the other board . ) So do you see those private schools as engaged in child abuse ?
&quot; Actually the Apocrypha is made up of pre-Christian texts , and late 4th century is a bit of a stretch for the new testament , certainly all its component texts were widely accepted by the 2nd century . I don &apos;t whether it is &quot; &quot; generally accepted &quot; &quot; that the text was altered , it seems to me that you are projecting your own views based on the hypotheses of some scholars on to Biblical scholarship in general . &quot;
Oh , I LOVE semantics games
I don &apos;t get you here .
So why should merchant ships be required to go unarmed and defenseless in dangerous areas ?
The anti-abortionists claim that would be killing a human life to save one .
Actually , selection occurs by differential reproductive rates . What this means is that organisms which reproduce more will have more offspring than the others ( obviously ) . Therefore , traits that help organisms reproduce will become more prevailant .
And SS is once again wrong . If you really believe that then try to tell your genes to give you tiger stripes which will be inherited by your children . Good luck .
We already accept that it is . You don &apos;t have to convince us . However , consider what this does to your argument that natural selection is random .
Better is worse ? See above .
they may respect life but what about respecting the quality of life ? if they cared about their children &apos;s future they would not breed like rabbits . It is callous to use their children to win the &apos; numbers game &apos; quality before quantity . I don &apos;t deny that abortion is murder in the womb though .
&quot; My recollection is similar to yours . I encountered it in an AP biology class in high school , we spent about 1 / 2 the extra-long class in labs ( I think that was the primary difference ) . The giraffe example was an &quot; &quot; aha &quot; &quot; moment for me personally , I suspected life changed , but the specifics I had never thought about . I recall a disclaimer at the start of the section , but I don &apos;t recall the exact wording . -Mach &quot;
False . See above .
Since you bring it up , I do think that you are a nut . But your site is even nuttier . Not one shred of evidence that I found - just assertion . Moreover , the author doesn &apos;t seem to know the difference between an hypothesis and a theory .
It &apos;s a flawed step in the right direction . I support it compared to nothing . I did not support it when they were considering CUs vs. full marriage . They took the politically expedient way out . Lest you leap to any unwarranted conclusions , my main objection is the blatent inequality inhererent in CUs .
So individual cells contract to move cytoplasm around and to transport oxygen within itself ?
&quot; And depending on what human is &quot; &quot; finding the answers &quot; &quot; it can unfortunately cheapen and deny many central Biblical teachings . &quot;
Our emphasis on Police and crime fighting reduced crime . Not gun control ! Our murder rate is largely an Inner City drug and drug gang related problem . Fix that and then you will finally be doing something !
It would be a great scientific discovery .
Prove it . Got any credible scientific or sociological studies ? NOPE , ya don &apos;t . Didn &apos;t think so .
It would be &apos; an &apos; analogy , but like the language analogy , it has its limitations . It is interesting to note that creationist computer software developers / programmers cannot seem to agree on the implications of &apos; mutations &apos; when using such analogies - one such person , C.K. Lester , declared that computer programs can accumulate up to 30 % &apos; random change &apos; , just like DNA ( hypothetically ) can , therefore , the computer analogy is a good one . But programmer R. David Pogge declares that even a single altered bit in a line of computer code a million bits in length would destroy it .
Oh sorry , I didn &apos;t understand what you were asking . Ok , what I think happened { Like Tasyfish hinted at } was that Moses recorded what god told him or Genesis 1 because it is in more detail , and Genesis 2 is what was passed down through Noah , in Oral history , so it would differ slightly , but that &apos;s becaue of man &apos;s error , not God &apos;s .
That &apos;s because its sophistry . Its an inherent contradiction and it simply means we don &apos;t have the capacity to understand it . Another more common example is that the assertion that the universe cannot be endless , and yet as far as we know it is . Trying to understand it is for us humans like an ant trying to fathom the theory of relativity . Damn are we ever conceited as a race ... we seem to think that if we can &apos;t understand something , it cannot be . We also tend to think , in every generation , that we have achieved somehow the pinnacle of progress .
Right . It &apos;s called stasis . Species that are well adapted to their environments tend to change little in a stable environment . It is still true that fossil crocs are not the same as modern crocs . There are obvious differences .
Wow . A very unusual and distressing story , and probably why saline abortions are no longer used . It is very unfortunate for her to have to live with that disability .
Like most things theists that statement is based on ignorance .
You could try to be a good person and nevermind about the hocus pocus stuff . I &apos;m not tryimg to convince you of anything . The fact is that what you use a reasons to believe don &apos;t hold up under logical scrutiny . Don &apos;t justify faith with logic . That only cheapens faith .
Pregnancy is always harmful to the woman &apos;s body . However , if the pregnancy is desired then the changes are welcomed by the woman . To a woman who does not want to be pregnant then those changes are very unwelcome and are a bad thing . Pregnancy is always harmful , but the perception of what is happening changes depending on the woman . You do not understand that whether or not pregnancy harms the woman &apos;s body is objective , but whether or not the woman wants the pregnancy anyway depends on the woman . You are mixing the two .
I think he meant a sycophant .
So let me get this straight - you admit that you are wrong , and you want me to provide documentation to prove this admission correct ? How about we both simply agree that you were wrong and move on .
If you feed me a lot of caffinated coffee i start to wiggle and squirm too . I &apos;m not really in any pain .
Wouldn &apos;t it be wonderful if every woman in the world had access to decent prenatal care , if every woman in the world could be guanateed safe childbirth , wouldn &apos;t it be wonderful ? The entire series is at : http : / / www.nytimes.com / 2009 / 05 / 10 / opinion / 10gift.html And , if men had to suffer the torture of being in labor for a week and having their insides torn out , don &apos;t you think the male-centered world would truly care more about the welfare of women and children ?
Well , your parents &apos; parents also had parents who had parents who had parents which all streams back down to 2 people who God created ... adam and eve. so ultimately your life is a gift from God because the whole human race was created by Him .
Can I tidy up this leftover part ... ? Fractionally .
Certainly it does .
So ? In your religion &apos;s view , everyone sins . Their sin is no greater or more unforgiveable than yours .
So then women who are pregnant shouldn &apos;t be allowed to 1 ) Smoke 2 ) Take any kind of drug that could possibly harm the child 3 ) Drink or do any otherwise legal action ? And VOR takes another giant step towards fascism .
Well , actually society has said that 18 is the dividing line . It can then also say , that under certain circumstances , for a particularly bad person , in some cases it will be considered if the person is 16 or 17 . That &apos;s why we have all the judges and lawyers , etc ...
So , we are debating creation , yet you don &apos;t consider quoting the bible , the single most important original proponent of the creation account and to you , it doesn &apos;t qualify as a source for what is being discussed here ? You say this and expect to be taken seriously ?
Because ? The conventional big bang is just as unlikely as God . Therefore your claim is wrong . However the current believe mainly among physicists and astronomers is that there is no end and there is no beginning to the universe . Expansionary theories along with contractionary theories that are being observed have led many to believe that the current universe was born from the death of the last universe . There is no end and there is no beginning . You are out of your league .
Actually , evolution occurs on the level of the population : individuals don &apos;t change , but populations do . See the examples above .
Because you people keep wanting one restriction after another after another after another . Nothing is ever good enough for you , you always want more than ever . Well we don &apos;t want to abide by your wishes , gun ownership is a recognized right , and your hatred of rights won &apos;t be tolerated . We &apos;re not going to just stand by and be painted as the bad guys because you have the mentally disabled belief that banning gun ownership will reduce crime , and anybody who disagrees with you want to see people killed .
Nobody I know sanctions adultery . There are already serious consequences built in against it . As far a same sex marriage , I know of nobody that is suggesting legal penalties for it unless one considers the refusal to legally recognize it a legal penalty . Certainly nobody has been jailed or fined for attempting such marriages . Privately performed ceremonies as such are not punished .
Oh shut up ! You &apos;re just sore because your side lost in the McDonald case and now you &apos;re left with absolutely nothing . You know that many gun laws are going to fall to the sword of justice , and you just can &apos;t stand the fact that your side is going to be brought back into check , just like any other .
Object to the woman being required to remain pregnant when she does not want to be .
The subject matter would be life forms . The units would depend on which particular aspect you were studying For instance to the question &apos; what units of measurement would you use for the effect of evolution ? I would say genetic changes that have patterns . ID would have that and more .
Well I think that the geology of the planet would influence everything . From religions to morals and scientific progression . Because long ago on our planet Europe not only thought the world was flat and they could fall over at the edge into an abyss but Europe generally didn &apos;t have knowledge of the Asian cultures until the silk road was active . If the asian and european cultures were not so greatly distanced from each other history would have been greatly changed to the extent that compared to our world would be pretty loopy
Actually , for his hypothesis to explain the difference , he would have to say that the DNA changed . Even so , he assumes more .
Well , your reasoning is certainly muddled , and it seems to be confused with some sort of twisted socio-political agenda , but I don &apos;t think I would characterize your piece a filthy collage . But you can call you stuff what you want .
Right . The frenquecy of the alles have changed over time .
&quot; And the mall plainly had &quot; &quot; no guns allowed &quot; &quot; signs displayed at all the entrances , meaning the shooter broke the law when he brought his gun in and started shooting . Now , find me a school massacre that took place where concealed carry is actually legal on campus . &quot;
&quot; You are correct , but contingency must be in place to deal with it when it occurs . Look at what happened in Eire with &quot; &quot; Case X &quot; &quot; in 1992- what happens when a country with the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe has to face up to the issue of pregnacy as a consequence of rape : http : / / www.prochoiceforum.org.uk / ireland6.asp Pages 12-13 of this EU report ( Adobe Acrobat reader required ) : http : / / www.newr.bham.ac.uk / pdfs / Repr ... m % 20Bremen.pdf &quot;
I hope I have already begun to change your mind .
So when you &apos;re doing math , you &apos;re an atheist ? Of course not . Just because there is overlap doesn &apos;t mean that the two views are identical .
Well , the claim isn &apos;t that they were identical , just that they preceded Jesus and were very similar .
This obviously depends on the person . Both are not good ... once again , a comparision is not gonna work . Whether you are an alcoholic or a weed-a-holic ( not a real word ) you will still mess up your health ( which is a good reason we shouldn &apos;t have public health care ) .
Yes . Only the ignorant think not .
&quot; Yes . I believe it &apos;s a matter of personal individual freedom . If purchased legally , and not used to commit a crime , what harm comes from handgun ownership ? I don &apos;t own one , but I own many other guns . If they can ban handguns , what &apos;s to stop them from banning shotguns , or even BB guns ? I don &apos;t believe in a nanny state , taking away my toys &quot; &quot; for my own good &quot; &quot; . Waxy &quot;
And for good reason . Electrical engineers in general have a pretty poor track record when discussing issues that have nothing to do with ... electrical engineering . Examples : Walter ReMine , Fred Williams , etc .
So even though you can legally conceal carry right up to the gate of the national parks , and you can legally hunt within the parks , somehow concealed carry in the parks will become more dangerous ?
So , you don &apos;t see how stating that in a functioning democratic society guns belong only in the hands of the state is not anti gun ? ? Maybe you could give us an example of a statement that is more anti gun that that because I am having trouble imagining one .
Well sigma , which is more painful ? ? Being burnt with salene for 30 minutes to an hour and if that doesnt work after the 3rd time , being born prematurally and laid on a table and starving to death ..... OR A woman sticking a clothes hanger up and accidentally killing herself but intentionally killing the kid within her ? seems to me that people dont really care about how the baby feels . It has just as much feeling as the mother .
Well I &apos;m glad its no problem for your son . No child deserves to be harrassed .
&quot; If same sex couples are offered equal rights under a PACS ( or some other legally recognized union ) as married couples , why does it matter which &quot; &quot; door &quot; &quot; they come in through ? They get all the same benefits , including the benefits that come when one partner dies . What &apos;s the beef ... except that you can &apos;t say that you &apos;re &quot; &quot; married &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
So , your saying an eyewitness would mean nothing . Yeah right .
Prove it then . If this is a fact , there will be research on the subject on the net somewhere comparing the effects of the two . In terms of addiction , alcohol is far worse than pot apparently. http : / / www.tfy.drugsense.org / tfy / addictvn.htm
It &apos;s NOT any of my business , but when presenting information to the readers at large , such topics need to be # # # # ing addressed , something militant pro-abortionist seldom want to bring up . I &apos;m actually happy that you had a good operation and think more should go into ensuring ALL women have the same low risk proceedures when necessary . We &apos;re dealing with health aspects , all , not just selective . And there may even be things I &apos;m not aware about to consider .
Actually , submitting samples that will return bogus dates is dishonest . Creationists have done this several times .
Ditto squared . If they support killing a perfectly healthy unborn child , they will argue that the reason stated in the Op is the main reason Abortion is needed and justified . And I must say that if 98 % of all abortions were performed for that reason , the public stance against them might not be so strong .
But is the Red Cross Christian ? Obviously most contributors are Christian . That &apos;s obvious as most Americans are Christian .
Actually , I snipped your remarks because 1 ) you twisted what I said and 2 ) I &apos;m already spending too much time arguing with random complainers and I was in a hurry to do something more important at the time .
&quot; This is different than stating that abortion is the same , in principle , as killing a born child . We are back on the question of &quot; &quot; Why would someone do this horrible thing &quot; &quot; which pro-life people continually ask and has been answered in many ways by many people . There are many threads on the subject That the fetus did not come into existance by it &apos;s own choice is really irrelevant . That it did not cause problems of it &apos;s own actions does not mean that it does not cause problems . &quot;
And you people whine at me about using personal insults ( ) ... anyhow , once a fetus is eight months , I believe , they are fully developed and ready for a premature birth . I was born prematurely , so don &apos;t tell me it doesn &apos;t happen . So if you get an abortion at eight months , you &apos;re not killing a fetus , you &apos;re killing a baby .
President Obama ! ? What did I win ! ?
And who makes the decision , Rich ? That &apos;s the issue , as I see it . I don &apos;t believe the government has any business in a woman &apos;s body .
So do you want to argue my points or do you want to argue me ? Which of my bullits are wrong ? Which of them are right ?
It is horribly oppressive of women , though , to oppose both abortion and contraceptives . That means that women will have no control over their pregnancies at all .
This question is premised on an untenable assumption : that people should not be allowed to vote on particular issues . This premise is clearly not true in any democratic society , and is especially not true in the United States . In the United States , it is a contradiction in terms to say someone is not allowed to vote on X. I have demonstrated this before , and yet the same silly question keeps coming up .
Do you mean someone who was wrong ? I asked you before to give an example of where Newton found empirical evidence of God . You failed to do so . I suspect that you can &apos;t .
Apparently , all them dinosaurs were just too dumb to climb to higher ground or swim ( despite the fact that animals are among the first to do so in disasters - example would be the tsunami in Christmas 2004 ) All of this also avoids the flying reptiles such as the Pteranodons . Also , apparently humans are unique in that they are the only ones whose corpses bload and float to the water &apos;s surface . What garbage will they come up with next ?
Are you saying that given enough time you can come with answers ? That &apos;s a statement of faith .
Why would that even be expected ? When you consider that it is important to maintain some sort of consistency in study populations , obvious mutants are excluded from the breeding stock . And yet , there are frequent observed mutations . In fact , my elder son once observed two mutations in a single fly in one of his populations . One fly had no wings and white eyes .
What basis do fundamental rights derive from ? In other words , how can we tell whether something is a fundamental human right ?
and section 6
I think such a move would qualify as a recognized declaration of war .
Different sort of penetration , so no .
Please off one scientific piece of evidence in support of biblical creation .
No , I think you &apos;re trying to do more than that . You &apos;re trying to say that the increase in crime is due to a lack of gun ownership , aren &apos;t you ? Because if you are , the article you cite doesn &apos;t back up that claim . What , no actual data to back up any of your claims ? Do you have access to US crime numbers ? How many armed breakins do you get in a country where people do have guns ? That &apos;s the comparison that needs to be made here .
Just to be sure you understood , it was the picture below that picture you were supposed to look at .
So , in other words , what you &apos;re saying is that the Pope , who just declared that all Christian Churches apart from the RCC to be false churches , including we evangelicals / fundamentalists is a fundie himself ? JPs right Matt , take your meds and do it quickly .
I &apos;m glad to see you &apos;ve finally come around .
The counter arguments put forth by its critics do not defeat the Violinist arguments , at the very least . Whether one accepts the argument anyway is another story : P
People are protected by law from being harassed , assaulted and / or murdered because they are people . Not because they are a certain religion . Because they are people it would be wrong to allow such things .
no , you just live on delusions. you can &apos;t argue the merits of creationism on their own because they don &apos;t exist . Creationism is a fraud regardless of the existance of evolution .
&quot; Contraceptives ( for example a condom / the pill ) aren &apos;t going to last a month effectively . Then there &apos;s the fact that contraceptives , given the above data , can still be 99 % effective , as it doesn &apos;t mention how many pregnancies they &apos;ve prevented . What does the writer make of this though ? &quot; &quot; According to this , condoms have a high failure rate for pregnancy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think a more telling question would be , why the hell would you rather feel constantly threatened than feel safe ? It seems completely idiotic to me . Smiley
By removing you mean Killing the innocent of course , which is different to imprisonment of the criminal .
Because you asked me to quote your lies . I did . Not only can you not find whichever source you claim speaks of birds &apos; infrared vision , you apparently can &apos;t find any source that does so . Despite this , you &apos;ve been whining about how visible and UV camouflage must be moot because of birds IR vision . And to top it off , rather than admit to your mistaken memory , you &apos;re blaming the imaginary source :
No , not really ...
Yep . Here in the U.S. , the 5.7 ammo is the ordinary hollow point for Civilian use . It does not penetrate . It is not Armor Piercing .
Cases v United States , 131 F. 2d 916 ( 1st Cir . 1942 ) , cert . Denied sub nom . , Velazquez v. U.S , 319 U.S. 770 ( 1943 ) . Basically , The US Curcuit Court upheld that the Second Amendment didn &apos;t apply to weapons that couldn &apos;t be carried by an individual .
why the comparison of gun owners yo violent killers and serial rapists ? What law have I broken ? Since we are doing comparisons your anti-freedom agenda is very similar to the bazi gun control laws of the 1930s , it is like the jim crow laws of the US . Your agenda is one of racism . This is insulting , ignorant , and shows your true colors as an enemy of freedom .
So , in summary , you aren &apos;t against the death penalty on principle . You just want it used judiciously ? Same here . Where we &apos;ll differ is in the details of what &apos;s judiciously .
But your proof didn &apos;t claim that God could do anything possible . Maybe only one person could build a computer , maybe one person could make a car , maybe one person could run the mile in under 4 minutes . That doesn &apos;t mean that God can do ALL of these things . It means that whoever we define to be the greatest being , we can call him god and thus he exists . Of course this wouldn &apos;t be sufficient to Christians as this says that God is probably mortal and has the limits of being a physical being .
&quot; Why don &apos;t you just sum it up with &quot; &quot; If you &apos;re not a fundamentalist Christian &quot; &quot; ? You also fail to consider Christian agnostics . &quot;
If you think something is correct then you believe this . That &apos;s all believe means . I believe the above statement is very true . Except that you wouldn &apos;t have to completely change your ideas or beliefs about the universe all the time . But you &apos;d have to modify them . Anyway , who said beliefs had to be static and fixed ?
So why are you here ? Do you have anything to offer of any substance ?
&quot; That clearly went whooshing over your head . It was intended to mock the OP . ( Interesting &quot; &quot; new &quot; &quot; bibilical revelation , indeed . ) I don &apos;t put any credence in silly comparisons like the trite Kennedy / Lincoln litany that arose in the 60 &apos;s or the similarly absurd list that INRI posted . They both demonstrate how one can concoct meaningless comparisons in an attempt to invent a non-existent connection between two unrelated events . It is the same for all &quot; &quot; prophesies &quot; &quot; . &quot;
just how i said it ... opinion ... like , what you think of it
&quot; So please , feel free to leave this thread to those who DO wish to discuss the issue . No one is forcing you to discuss the topic of this or any other thread . I notice you evidently are not interested in &quot; &quot; Understanding &quot; &quot; Sexual Prejudice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That is absolutely fine with me . Or are you now opposed to &quot; &quot; Freedom of Speech &quot; &quot; also ? &quot;
Hehe . Putting political messages on such things seems retarded to me though . -Wez
You &apos;re working at the wrong end of the problem . We need young to survive . It &apos;s the old that are expendable .
Well , I suppose that the reply it took me almost 5 minutes to type , a couple more to check and a couple to correct will not suffice now .
yes and my post was proving that
No Ted Kennedy is not a fundie but Vitter is . For God sake the pope is a nazi and a fundie . Marlene Elwell , the nazi * itch , who put the evil mariage amendment on the michigan ballot is a Roman Catholic also . If you are a christian and you believe in the suppression of homosexuality then you are a fundie and a christianist .
The main incentive for a male child is that in China you can only have one child without severe penalties and a female child means the family name is lost .
I see no reason why secular shows should be required to mention your mythology .
That &apos;s true , but how much have we actually learned , and how much have we theorized , with an atheist presupposition , the only presupposition currently allowed ?
I think they should . I mean , if you &apos;re under 18 , you are still under your parent &apos;s guardian . I feel like they have the right to know if their child is getting an abortion .
Obviously not about abortion .
would that be legaly owned guns , or criminals who have guns ( and also ues guns ) for there crimes ? most Gang members have guns , if they are killed in a drive by shooting , is the gun responsable , or would it be the illegal activitys ?
You not differentiating between the beaver and the beaver dam , the bird and the bird &apos;s nest or the man and the man &apos;s truck . The dams , nests and truck do not occur naturally ... they are constructed by the naturally occuring animals using materials that occur in nature ( albeit we have to smelt the iron and vulcanize the rubber whilst the birds and beavers just stick stuff together ) .
What other theories ? Why mention them if you aren &apos;t going to explain them ? You are actually on a board of education ? I notice there was no mention of telling kids that there are other theories of gravity and that all of them have holes . Evolution is a more secure theory than gravity .
Oh sinj.don &apos;t let it get you down , it don &apos;t mean nothing ( sorry couldn &apos;t help it )
Ingus , please see my comments at the end of my previous post . The purpose of this thread is to introduce ourselves and have a Q &amp; amp ; A about the basis for each others views etc . If you want to debate the specific differences we may have in our views , either open a new thread and invite me over , challenge me , whatever ... But I &apos;m not going to debate it here . I think this thread is a great idea . People should introduce themselves , lay out their views however they see fit and let others do the same .
But we certainly have the right to evict such persons . But then , regardless , the embryo is not a person .
Everything basically . You &apos;re held captive by hostile natives that have set up barricades and checkpoints around the property you live on . They decide when you get to come in and go out , and the police have decided to abandon you rather than come to your aid . And Canada has laws that make defense with a firearm either impractical or out right illegal depending on just where you life .
Yea the legalizatioin of drugs would cause an epedimic of problems . Crime , suicide , mental health problems , and physical health problems .
Interesting thought ..... such a situation would theorectically remove the division of opinion that exists based upon the perspective of gender ( ie. the pro-life religious male ) and would make any difference of opinion be based on moral / philosophical considerations alone . You could argue it would shift opinion towards the mix currently held by women as everyone would be in the position of having to bear pregnancy . Given that there is a full mix of religious and other beliefs in the current day female population perhaps this would be a good analogy to such a state of being you suggest .
The Skeptic has requested no judges . This actually suits me as there are too many of you that I &apos;d have to pick from and I therefore avoid slighting anyone by not picking them
Just like we waited until after society decided how it would view civil rights for blacks ? No one is forcing you to debate the constitutional issues . If you don &apos;t wish to , fine ; don &apos;t . I seriously doubt if anyone would miss your input .
Yet another alleged lie , by the Hillary-haters , shown not to be .
I believe studies have already been done on that subject .
And you believe that to be what ? You really need to just say who / what you think the Creator is to save us from having to make all these clarification posts .
We don &apos;t live on carbon dioxide . We live from the energy stored in carbon compounds when we break them down .
Uh ... yeah ? Is there some other way than evolution this can happen ? Evolution encompasses speciation which results from evolution taking different paths when populations are separated by some factor in their environment or geographically . Are you saying you believe that the species have all somehow resulted from a common genome yet at the same time rejecting evolution as an explanation ?
There &apos;s absolutely no way in hell this could be legal in any sense . That California school got * * * * * slapped for expelling a student who had a gun off campus , beyond the jurisdictional reach of the school . So how can this school believe they can get away with such an insane policy ?
But still , if you think there are rights in the bill of rights that is wrong , that should not be granted or guaranteed , it would be a viable option to vote for removing them . What debate are you trying to end here ? The debate : &apos; do you want little or less gun-control &apos; ?
And how is this a bad thing ?
Oh , don &apos;t be so hasty Bear in mind that at the scale upon which bacteria operate , molecules are significant physical structures . The bacterial flagellum , for instance , is an outboard motor constructed directly out of proteins , which are in turn directly , physically translated via RNA from DNA sequences . The physical shape of the folded molecular structure of those proteins is what makes the motor work . So there &apos;s nothing abstract about the relationship between DNA and the organism &apos;s physical form or abilities .
Heart bypass , prostate cancer ....... I have a couple of Canadian friends who needed those surgeries and one was told he had a 4 month wait and the other a 6 month wait so they both came down to Bellingham Wash and had the Surgery within 2 weeks ............
So my question is this : Why doesn &apos;t a chihuahua birthe a Siberian husky in the Antarctic , or even in Siberia ? Oh , my other question is this : Why do animals die young instead of adapt ?
&quot; And religion is what caused the Crusades and most other wars in the past , and many wars , and bloody disputes , to this very day . Many , many , many , many , many more people have died in the name of religion than in anything that could be called &quot; &quot; in the name of atheism &quot; &quot; . &quot;
And certain versions of Mark : 15He said to them , “ Go into all the world and preach the good news to all creation . 16Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved , but whoever does not believe will be condemned . 17And these signs will accompany those who believe : In my name they will drive out demons ; they will speak in new tongues ; 18they will pick up snakes with their hands ; and when they drink deadly poison , it will not hurt them at all ; they will place their hands on sick people , and they will get well . ” Are they mistakenly reading this ?
So , because they don &apos;t interpret the bible as you do , they believe that there are no deities ? That is what you said ...
Nice try . If America was an Ally to Germany during WWII , to this day you wouldn &apos;t forgive US Citizens no matter what excuse they have .
The article cautions on blithely using natural selection as an explanation for the features of the genetic code . Article 9 : In this article , the functional integrity and how the architecture of the code relates to it is discussed . From the article :
Yep , he dodged it again . Care to explain your views on Creation in the Tanakh for the folks here ?
Guess what , I &apos;m pro-life as well , that is why I &apos;m also pro-choice .
I &apos;ve never been to Amsterdam . A friend of mine went and he liked it . I &apos;d like to go someday . Hell , I &apos;d just like to get my XXX anywhere , really .
yes , but adam wasnt created with hereditary information or from sperm and egg cells. adam was the prototype. any subsequent humans should be born following the fashion in which adam was made. otherwise adam could have been shaped like a goat and still bear human children , because god could have formed him into whatever shape or lack of shape he wanted , yet put the genetic information in him to produce human offspring. why should adam &apos;s children look like adam ? wouldnt adam &apos;s children be born the way adam was created , or not ?
actually they probably drifted much faster than that ..... probably upon a pole reversal .
Manslaughter involves a direct action that causes an unintentional death . Miscarriage is involuntary ; besides the person suffering a miscarriage might well want to keep the baby . To equate miscarriage with manslaughter is preposterous .
You know that , I know that , but the creationists do not know that .
Well , those who keep using that story can &apos;t see the real sins of those cities . They are so sure that it was rampent homosexuality which lead to their destruction . Even though we know that before the Angels were ever sent God had spelled out why he was going to destroy them . He sent the angels because they promiced to find even one righteous man . They failed in that because the angels were attacked for being foreigners . Noone who abuses this story is ever going to admit this fact . They can &apos;t see past the supposed homosexual issue .
It has a financial impact on ALL taxpayers . To say that it has no impact on anyone else is disengenuous .
Whether a fetus is a person is not something open to consideration . An apple is not an orange . The reason that we have two words to apply as labels is simply because they absolutely are not the same thing . It is that simple . Suppose that a fetus is frozen and implanted in a female 22 years later . Is it of legal drinking age at birth ? Obviously not . We currently have the technology to actually do this .
Yes , they do show a faithful devotion to the ultimate reality that there are no gods . You &apos;re an atheist , aren &apos;t you ?
If you wanted to be picky about it , I guess you could say that it was a form of last-ditch birth control , after the other forms failed .
Is it correct to assume that in the presence of the precursors of the standard genetic code ( e.g. intermediates of glucose degradation and the citric acid cycle ) , the intimate relationship between these molecules resulted in the inevitable organization of the genetic code ( global optimum of the system ) ? Articles 5-7 These articles discuss fascinating mathematical representation of the genetic code . For example , in article 6 a representation of the genetic code as a six – dimensional Boolean hypercube is proposed . Abstract :
But only if they &apos;re willing to receive one . Most aren &apos;t .
That was the past . I &apos;m speaking of now .
Actually it wouldn &apos;t . Since there is no rational , believable evidence for creationism , it wouldn &apos;t be any more believable if evolution were disproved . As an example , I dare you to start a thread in an appropriate forum and give us tested evidence for a global flood as depicted in Genesis . Good luck .
Because violent crime and violent criminals is something that I can &apos;t control . Heart disease , that can be worked on with good diet , exercise and medicine if necessary . It &apos;s manageable , controllable and can be avoided . You can &apos;t do that with a violent criminal .
Why are you against abortion ?
Well , that &apos;s generally true of any process that uses energy . Some is wasted .
Look over the Heller ruling again . All nine judges agreed unanimously that the Second Amendment protected a right that was wholly individual in nature . The only disagreement was whether the right still applied today . And no , the individual states and cities shouldn &apos;t be allowed to set their own standards for a constitutional right , that flies in the face of the 14th Amendment . And worse , you &apos;re arguing for precedent that would basically allow the various states to not respect your other rights ; they could ban the shirt you choose to wear because it &apos;s offensive to some small , insignificant minority somewhere .
So you &apos;re actually claiming that it is a lie to say that the UK has a lower gun crime rate than the US ? Even if the police were miscounting crimes it &apos;s still a huge and unjustified leap in logic to conclude from that that the UK does not have a lower gun crime rate .
So what ? I don &apos;t care ! Gun ownership is an individual right and that &apos;s the end of it ! You don &apos;t have to exercise a right hundreds of thousands of times a year for it to be protected by the Constitution .
I see I jumped the gun . That was well stated .
Which is what they did to the Jews .
So you put words in Machs mouth . This would be acceptable if you were not doing it in a malicious fashion to get some sort of sadistic pleasure but you were instead actually trying to get him to explain himself . At any rate it totally disproves your nonsense about how you above me because you do not put words into peoples mouths because you do the same . You were not being dishonest to start with I admit it would be wrong to deliberately misrepesent you but neither of the circumstances apply here .
Really ? A lot of people say that every answer makes more questions . In some ways we seem to know less now than we did at the time of Newton , in that we are less certain . And Newton &apos;s laws deal with what happens in a vacuum with no resistance , not direct human experience At any rate , my point is that you can &apos;t see all the evidence as piling up support for &apos; science &apos; as &apos; science &apos; is moulded to fit that evidence . Not a criticism of science , btw .
well ... you gotta point there .
The comic relief doesn &apos;t even recognize it has passed in on , or attempted to !
And when supersport says that the fossil record was created by god to test the faith of the people ? He could make his hypothesis unfalsifiable , and he wouldn &apos;t care that it would be unscientific .
See Begging the Question
Stop trying to muddy the waters . I was talking about developed nations with lower murder rates . You suddenly bring Chicago into the debate- a city with open borders in a nation where guns are freely available . Even if gun control hasn &apos;t worked there it doesn &apos;t follow that gun laws can &apos;t work on a national level .
&quot; We know that now , but not because the sun rises every day , because we have identified other evidence that proves heliocentrism . The hypothesis &quot; &quot; the sun orbits the earth &quot; &quot; predicts it will rise and set every day , the hypothesis &quot; &quot; The earth is rotating &quot; &quot; predicts the same . &quot;
And compare that to an equivalent sized human - if you compared the skill to a 10-13 year old boy , the erectus skeleton &apos;s cranial capacity would be significantly smaller . Doesn &apos;t contradict in the slightest other than the bizarre positions you decide other people should hold .
Please explain this statement .
Same thing happened in Rwanda . First they put the names of all Tutsis on lists . Then , the Hutu came around with machettes and took them off of the lists .... permanently .
oh , now we &apos;re getting somewhere . Explain more , please . Oh , and some evidence of incremental modifications would be nice too .
You really have flipped over the edge into the desparate area of insanity . Please Penfold present some STATISTICS to back up your wild accusations . IF you cannot present anything other than the disgraceful 43 ..... Then shut up Guns in the hands of law abiding citizens save lives , the statistics back this up from EVERY country EVER to introduce gun control .
The average global temperature follows a sinusoidal pattern , the general consensus is we are supposed to be approaching a peak . Projections show that instead of peaking , there will be continue to be an increase in average global temperature which exceeds that of the peak 4000 years previous .
What I find hard to believe is that politicians will place their decision above the right to life of a human person only for political expediency .
You think so ? Then accept my terms . Go ahead . See if you &apos;re right .
Really ? What evidence is that ?
The only person who can take away your sin is God . No human can ever cleanse himself of his sins , so get over it .
Our national parks are safe as is , huh ? Regular people have no reason to feel to need to carry concealed weapons for their own protection , huh ? How can you be safe when mexican drug cartel members are literally behind the next bush and inclined to kill you for stumbling upon their operation ?
But nonetheless fascinating !
Huh ? Did we win ? When ?
As the Christian Right &apos;s poster boy , this is hugely damaging , don &apos;t you think ? Also makes him very hypocritical ( or , dare I say , a FLIPFLOPPER ? ! ) since he is campaigning against open abortion now .
They do offer a good insulating blanket which would keep the body of the reptile warm which in turn , would allow the reptile to remain active for a longer period of time . This means more time to hunt and reproduce carrying the mutation onwards .
No . I never mentioned grades . You brought that one up . I &apos;m saying that having guns on school campus isn &apos;t a good plan due to the high level of emotions in the area .
Sorry , your going to have to explain to me how Swiss gun laws are in anyway relevant to a shooting in Missouri . Missouri allows concealed carry , it &apos;s unfortunate for the victims that ABB does not .
Well , yeah , if science hasn &apos;t provided an explanation for a phenomenon , then all we can do is shrug and submit grant proposals .
Well ! I guess that just showed you guys . It seems that HeavenBound thinks that having a closed mind is a bad thing . And yet ,
Well , how else were they supposed to reproduce ?
I don &apos;t believe Hell is a place either ( or even if I believe in hell to begin with ) , but tell me more about what you mean by this . It sounds interesting .
The &apos; teachings &apos; either have no substance , or are certainly not original . Demonstrate categorically just who is the Son of God , and why this figure commands worship and obeisance .
A person going to Hell is a consequence of sin . God doesn &apos;t want it , but he can &apos;t stop it .
Prove your assertion that he has called himself a conservative Christian rather than a conservative Republican OP . Support your clai if you can or stop trying to lump everyone on the right together .
Sorry , sometimes sarcasm is quite hard to read .
&quot; Read to the very end of the verse . &quot; &quot; If you are not pleased with her , let her go wherever she wishes . You must not sell her or treat her as a slave , since you have dishonored her . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I know , Chloe &apos;s misuse of the word strikes again .
There is just one thing however . The coelacanths found are different from those in the fossil record . Further , ALL evidence pointed to them being extinct , until we found other evidence , and we changed it . And , to top it off , the article says NEARLY extinct , not COMPLETELY . Although , this article was of course written after the coelocanths were re-discovered . Of course , this has absolutely nothing to do with the theory of evolution , which explains the mechanisms responsible for the change of allele frequencies in populations over time .
From that site :
&quot; Maybe you &apos;ll have to clear up the difference between &quot; &quot; understanding &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; knowing . &quot; &quot; I know what I think the difference is , but I need to know what you mean when you say &quot; &quot; I understand that there is definitely no god . &quot; &quot; Personally , I understand that we have no verification one way or another . All I know is that I don &apos;t know one way or the other . &quot;
You &apos;re right , I think he has made such comments . Sorry . I think he &apos;s wrong and went too far .
What else would you expect from the people who created a god in their own image ? Your thinking here is right , religion has a long history of being egocentric .
&quot; Nope . Not part of evolutionary theory . It would be stupid to claim that increased genetic variability would &quot; &quot; disallow &quot; &quot; any portion of the population from breeding . &quot;
Uh . No they didn &apos;t . Have you ever actually taken a biology course ?
&quot; How do you define &quot; &quot; convenience &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
Obviously not . If the right to life trumps all other rights , then it follows that the mother &apos;s right to life and the child &apos;s right to life cancel each other out . Mind you , if it &apos;s her choice then the pro-life movement endorses such heroism , right ?
&quot; Just like no one is really &quot; &quot; for &quot; &quot; abortions , but they think that it &apos;s the woman &apos;s right to decide . Maybe that &apos;s like when congress gave the President the right to decide to go to war , even when they were supposed to declare war . &quot;
If a child comes in for an abortion and fears abuse from her parents then law enforcement should be notified . The only people protected by opposing notification laws are abusers and pedophiles . No elective , invasive medical proceedure should be performed on a child without the consent of a parent or judge . If a minor is allowed to have an abortion without consent the parents / guardians will have no idea whats been done to this child should complications arise , they wouldn &apos;t be able to give this information to a ER doctor or the childs pediatrition .
What would you know about fair and balanced ? I know a lot of truths about gays . Do you want me to start posting incessant threads pointing them all out ? And I am the moderator for the formal debate forum , not the entire board . Want to debate me on the benefits of gays on society vs Christianity ?
These items do not have killing as their primary use .
&quot; Why not ? You said yourself kalifornia was a &quot; &quot; trend setter &quot; &quot; . It is alread the law in many states . &quot;
Oh dear God your ignorance is abundant ! Do you not understand what the federal DOMA law does ?
See above , yet again
You did when you talked about someone loving objects , or a mokey , etc .
Purposefully communicating information as a means to an end ... wound healing .
&quot; They can &quot; &quot; marry &quot; &quot; whomever they love . Benefits though , are a different matter . The state and society views marriage as an opposite-sex institution . It &apos;s not about anyone getting harmed ; no one said it was . &quot;
I see , thanks for answering my question .
But didn &apos;t they tell you ? They outsourced your job to me !
You know what they call people like you ? Victims .
Please define complexity . Please define information . Both definitions should be relevant to biology .
no base for calling it a human being ? Other than the fact that a fetus is scientifical a human being . Seems you have no basis for saying I can &apos;t call a fetus a human being .
Because most people are Christian .
But the military is pretty much all a volunteer thing . It &apos;s not a hiring process--employer / employee thing . That arrangement lends itself more to the soldier not volunteering for service in the first place .
I &apos;ll assume this is figurative since they do not literally melt .
So you have a scumbag democrat screeching hate speech and we are supposed to believe its true ! Get real baby even you don &apos;t believe this unless you have donated a vital organ associated with reasoning .
um , yeah , you could say that ... ( won &apos;t argue ... left up to the evolution board )
The attacker is usually armed in spite of gun control laws . All they do is disarm the law abiding . Not to mention the lack of enforcement on criminals .
Simple . The big government people will tell you that it &apos;s in everybody &apos;s best interest . The criminals will just kill you without debate .
&quot; Let &apos;s not confuse our readers. supersport is not saying it &apos;s evolution ; he &apos;s saying that &quot; &quot; evolutionists &quot; &quot; say that it &apos;s evolution . It should be clear now to the readers that scientists recognized perfectly well that this is an example of plasticity . &quot;
&quot; First , I think you may have misunderstood the &quot; &quot; pro-life mantra &quot; &quot; seeing how many pro-lifers think it permissable to disconnect life-support systems in certain circumstances , which necessarily results in a person &apos;s death . But nevertheless , I think we agree that for purposes of the abortion discussion , it is a closer analogy to assume the violinst is only connected for nine months , and no longer than if we assume the violinist to be connected for some other arbitrary period of time . Am I correctly discerning an agreement on that ? &quot;
You lost me there . Try them how and for what ?
Just because it is human doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s a human being . I &apos;m not sure what grade you &apos;re in but that &apos;s basic biology 101 . Your ears are human . Your ears are NOT human beings .
So I have the choice between staying safe and then claiming insurance damages , or risking my life to kill a burglar and ( likely ) cause damage to my own property in the process ? Somehow , I &apos;d rather stay safe . Better to lose my laptop than my life .
&quot; Well , you will find claims amoung this group that &apos; If Jews understood their own scriptures , they would accept Jesus as their Lord and Savior &apos; , and &quot; &quot; Christians are fullfilled Jews &quot; &quot; . &quot;
and thus a reason to support balanced reporting. true , there are indisputable facts. say 3000 died. but the interpretation of the facts are subjected to bias. the 3000 deserved to die as collaborators vs the 3000 were innocent and did not deserve to die .
* * Quod erat demonstrandum .
Read above for why your argument sucks . Thanks for proving you never ever ever read anything or watch anything given to you . Just assume whatever we want and hope people don &apos;t laugh at us ?
The article said very little about his observations and almost nothing about his methods .
You don &apos;t beleive that it is possible to do something wrong to prevent a larger number of wrongs in the future ? Do you think the ends can ever justify the means ?
Well , the first part is true but I &apos;m not sure I understand what you are saying in the second part . Science does not claim that intelligent design is false because science lacks the tools to examine the concept . ID is just another unsupported assertion outside the domain of science ( and logic for that matter ) . ID has reached the stage of unsupported assertion without evidence . Science has better explanations .
Oh , we don &apos;t have to - sorry , I wasn &apos;t clear enough there . What I &apos;m trying to do is correct your misapprehensions concerning common descent . You said this :
Is the Ammo Shortage the Result of a Government Conspiracy or an NRA Marketing Campaign ?
Actually , qualified biologists know no such thing . In fact , I &apos;ve never known one who would agree with that assertion . Can you give us some peer reviewed references to support your assertion ?
Just to point out , the class that ID is being taught in is a comparative religion class .
This is obviously not talking about abortion .
Mayabe this is a miniscule amount of suffering compared to what awaits you on the flipside . Weather it be an eternity of Bliss or agony and suffering . Who really knows . Mayabe those who have this happen to them have it coming to them ?
How many opponents of liberal gun laws live in urban areas ?
Yes the facts speak for themselves , they just don &apos;t sing the song you think they do . No biologist will find any need at all to wave any hands in this instance , for as you say the facts DO speak for themselves .
What else is new ?
I think it &apos;s true . Why would someone make that up and pass it off as a real event ? I think the continents probably started separating some time after that , which is how God separated the people .
So umm . What &apos;s going on ? This was posted a week ago plus about 4 hours ago . I frankly don &apos;t care if my opponent posts a day late and would hate to win because of time . BUT the first post was even easier , he could have been typing it as we found judges and I think he mentioned he had started already . I PMed him earlier this week reminding him of the limit and have not recieved a response . Of course maybe the fact that he hasn &apos;t logged on since 11 / 14 has something to do with that .
Unions fought to keep children out of work for the same reason they fought to keep blacks and women out of work - they want a monopoly on employment .
Yes , I &apos;ve noticed that . I do think part of the problem is that he hasn &apos;t bothered to get educated in the subject . From the arguments I &apos;ve seen from him over the time he &apos;s been here he seems to rely on YEC websites for information , and when he gets to something he doesn &apos;t know it seems like he cuts-and-pastes ( often without fuly reading ) from google ( leading to the Civil War Dinosaur fiasco and the Nazca stones fiasco ) that seems to support his views
Do you think this resistance got their most useful weapons out of a normal store ? Please don ´ t try such arguments without knowing about European history .
And yet the article is about a legal matter .
