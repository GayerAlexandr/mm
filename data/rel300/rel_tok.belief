There are a lot of arguments about the existence of GOD . Some try to prove scientifically and logically . What we need to know is that GOD is so much much bigger ( beyond our imagination ) than what we can think of . We cannot limit GOD with our ( limited and simple ) mind . GOD creates everything , there is no way that the created being can think about the CREATOR . In a simple analogy we can put it this way , a computer programme cannot explain about the programmer unless the programmer put it in the programme he or she wrote . The same way is with our GOD , unless GOD reveals to us ( humankind ) , there is no way we know or understand about GOD . The other thing that we need to know , we live in a different dimension from GOD . For this reason we cannot enter the other dimensions . Talking about poverty , sickness and all the problems in this world we cannot avoid not to talk about sins . To explain about this we need to refer to the original sin ( as what is written in the Bible in the book of Genesis ) . As we know , GOD so loves the world that HE has given HIS only begotten Son to die for humankind . From here we can see that GOD wants every single human being to be saved from &quot; the dead &quot; ( eternal separation from GOD ) . When GOD walked on this earth in form of humankind like us , HE also experienced all the sufferings known to this world . So , HE perfectly knows about this . Another thing we need to know is that life is more than &quot; walking &quot; on this planet ( which is only a very small fraction of the &quot; real &quot; life - in the life after ) . After all if we really want to know about GOD , we simply need to ask GOD to reveal HIMSELF to us so that we can understand what is beyond our ( limited and simple ) mind.By the way , if you are interested in knowing about this futher , based on my experience , there is an excellent book that explain clearly . The name of the book is &quot; The Progress of Redemption : The Story of Salvation from Creation to the New Jerusalem &quot; by Willem Vangemeren ( you can look at the internet ) .Finally , what I can say , if we really ask and humble ourselves , GOD will definitely reveal HIMSELF to us in HIS own way .
This one is going to be long . First off . If there was a god who created everything , how would you ... Prove he exists ? Prove that he DOSEN &apos;T exist . Prove that he pointed at the ground and said &quot; I want a cat there &quot; and there came a cat.Prove that he didn &apos;t make a couple of bacteria and work his way up from there . Bad things happen because god made a world of order . It may look like chaos but it is an order . And for order to work some things have to happen every once in a while . If you have a large body pulling in on its self your going to have friction . That friction makes heat which melts rock . This rock makes a molten core which causes convection currents which makes ; earth quakes , tsunamis and volcanoes . Does the occurrence of these things prove or disprove god ? It does neither . Some people live in poverty , some suffer and live in pain and death . Does this mean that there is no god , or that if there is that he doesn &apos;t care ? The bible says that he gave man free agency . If he were to pop down here and say hello to all of us , and help us out of our miseries what would happen to our agency ? If he jumped in and made a murder stop , wouldn &apos;t he have just over ridden that murder &apos;s agency ? If you wanted to know how people to make certain decisions , would you let them know that your there and watching , or would you keep your presence unknown ? Where in the bible does it say that god condemns people to hell ? What I read is that people condemn themselves , by not ever going back to god in the first place . As in &quot; I don &apos;t belong there , might as well not try &quot; not go back . Why is there evil if there is a god ? Why is there down if there is an up ? eh , I &apos;ll post more latter . Its like 3 am here .
More and more respected academics are seeing the immense flaws in the evolution argument . Problems involving irreducible complexity , the impossibility of forming proteans from amino acids without the guidance of DNA , the huge gaps in the fossil record among others are starting to be reasoned upon . Although many in the scientific community have posed counter-arguments , these often have minimal empirical evidence and are usually the result of a macrocosmic repression of the implications of these anti-evolution arguments.Although neither I nor anyone else can easily prove the existence of a God in a tangible way , Intelligent Design is quite evident and provides a much more scientifically sound argument than the statistically improbable and flawed reasoning of the evolution argument.Unfortunately , it is so easy to only see the evidence which is most convenient for us , thereby leading us to a divided scientific community , and thus divided society on the matter of the existence of God .
&quot; One theory doesn &apos;t become true just because your incredulity makes it difficult to accept other theories . &quot; There is actually insufficient emperical evidence for both intelligent design as well as for evolutionary theory . I am not suggesting that intelligent design is magically correct simply because one cannot completely prove evolution . What I am saying , however , is that if you take an objective look at the research conducted by those in the scientific community who support intelligent design as well as those who support evolutionary theory , intelligent design theory makes more sense , and has fewer logical flaws than evolution . I have studied evolutionary theory in depth at university level , and I notice that most people who respond to discussions such as this one either do not even know the basics of evolution , or have extremely limited knowledge of peer-reviewed , published research done on intelligent design , and thus make ignorant assumptions and statements regarding intelligent design .
The pro ID post at the start of this thread makes many claims about an alleged failure of science to explain things . I disagree - but let &apos;s accept it for arguments sake.But even if all scientific knowledge ( every last bit of it ) were faulty , that would say nothing about the possible existence of God . The poster then goes on to say that they can &apos;t prove the existence of God - in other words there is no evidence for the existence of god.There follows an unsubstantiated assertion that ID is better . As a post apparently designed to support the existence of God it seems a little unconvincing .
Very well said ; my hats off to you . : )
I am a bit disappointed in the human race . The human race as a whole has tried for centuries to X out God and any religious ideas and characteristics . I am rather embarrased of the ignorance of men . Anyways , this has to be the most silly question in history-if you &apos;re educated and have any sense of moral sense you would agree . If the world wasn &apos;t created by the Supreme Being ( GOD ) , than how else would it have gotten here . If any one person ( or organization ) expect me to ever believe that Earth one day just decided to appear in space and isolate the water from land and create it &apos;s own self a moon and set the sun impeccably in it &apos;s place and everything revolve and correlate in it &apos;s proper manner every morning-day-season-year etc . , , Than they are the most foolish , silly alive . There is but one explaination of the being of Earth and that &apos;s through Jesus Chridst himself . I am not typing this to reprimand , discourage or convert but simply to make a &quot; common sensed &quot; point to any and all readers that come across this comment . As the literary C.S. Lewis once said , &quot; You either believe in God or don &apos;t ... &quot; He himself gave numerous reasons as to the reason that God does exist and how He is the creator of all things living and non living ; dead and alive . Just a simple point to leave you with : If God didn &apos;t create the world and everything in it , then who did ? Are we seriously , as &quot; educated &quot; men and women suggesting that we all derive from monkeys ? ? ! ! I would hope that we &apos; educated &apos; people no better than this . God is , was , and is to come . God Bless every reader . : ) I &apos;m still disappointed at our ignorance though : (
Till the sun starts expanding , I think . That always kept me up at night as a child--The whole world will burn away.I &apos;ll tell you my answer to that question , which combines my religious beliefs and my career aspirations age four . We &apos;re supposed to go there . We &apos;re supposed to go into space , to explore , to learn and to discover . Humans are supposed to spread out and see new sights , reach new horizons . When we get on a boat and sail halfway around the world , when we build submarines and underwater research labs--when we walk to a part of town we haven &apos;t been before , we &apos;re doing what we &apos;re supposed to do . That &apos;s a part of the human condition . G-d just made all that stuff so that we &apos;d have someplace to go next . When that &apos;s all explored , I have no doubt that there &apos;ll be some other world to discover .
How could anyone possibly explain with definition how our world came to be when that individual wasn &apos;t there at that particular time ? We do like many others before us .... we read the Bible . Simple ! !
&quot; You are just substituting the existence of Universe with existence of ( a ) god ( s ) . The current scientific view of the beginning of the current Universe is a &apos; big bang &apos; . This is a &quot; singularity &quot; , ie we do not yet know anything on the &quot; other side &quot; of the big bang . &quot; &quot; Substituting with ( a ) god ( s ) only points us to question what is the beginning of god . If god is without beginning and without end , why can &apos;t we also think of the current without beginning and end - BTW , to all practical purposes , the beginning of the Universe has no implication to our current living . &quot; Could not the converse of that statement be true in regards to you ( that you are substituting God with the universe ) . Invoking God isn &apos;t the slightest bit circular , and it doesn &apos;t mean that God must require a cause . The law of casualty states that every effect ( contingent being ) has a cause . God is not an effect , nor is God a contingent being . The universe , on the other hand , is composed of matter , and the chief characteristic of matter is mutability ( it can be changed ) . So therefore , the universe is contingent and requires a cause . God on the other hand , is an immaterial being who is comprised of no parts . As such , He is irreducibly simple , and thus does not require a cause . You can &apos;t just simply plug in the &quot; Who made X &quot; objection to everything there is . Your capitalization of the word &quot; universe &quot; strikes me as odd . It &apos;s ironic in the sense that you &apos;re essentially deifying the universe , which is nothing but an impersonal , arational , and amoral reality.So in summary , God does not require a cause because God is not comprised of physical parts ( divine simplicity ) , while the universe does because it manifests contingency ( being made out of matter , which is mutable ) .
&quot; There are a lot of arguments about the existence of GOD . Some try to prove scientifically and logically . What we need to know is that GOD is so much much bigger ( beyond our imagination ) than what we can think of . We cannot limit GOD with our ( limited and simple ) mind . &quot; In other words , God exists no matter how nonsensical the idea is to our minds and no matter the amount of evidence to the contrary that our minds can perceive ....
If the world were perfect , we would all be robots without the choices to do good or evil . That is not love , that is slavery . This is not what God wanted for us.God created us and knows our nature , therefore at creation he knew that we would have to sacrifice his son on the cross for our sins , in order to perfect his creation in heaven . He also knew that we would suffer for the sins of our fathers and our fellow souls.We can not see the entirity of our existence , for example when my nephew was killed in Iraq , it was an incredible sadness , but now four years later we appreciate the fullness of his life and the splendidness of his sacrifice . He gave up his earthly life to save others in his battalion . Yet these two things existed together at the same instant , though at his death we did not see his , and the effect of his life on others for years to come.A really good book to read on this subject is called &quot; The Shack . &quot;
When we look in our children &apos;s eyes and see ourselves , our values , our family &apos;s best hope we KNOW that there is a God who put us here . Who gave us a reason for living . A reason for making a difference on this earth . Who can deny the existence of a higher order ?
&quot; This is my work and my glory to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man . &quot; ( Moses 1 : 39 ) If we come to know not only that God exists but who He is and what our potential is , it would put this small moment in eternity we call life in perspective . Imagine a string pulled from New York to Las Angeles . Now imagine a pin inserted in that string somewhere in the middle , say Nebraska . That pin is to represent this earth life . The possibility of eternal life back in our heavenly home is an &quot; actual implication &quot; and a very important one . I am Christian and therefore , an &quot; actual implication &quot; is the importance of the vicarious sacrifice of Jesus Christ ; the great and last sacrifice . To me the existence of God is tied directly to Jesus Christ . This is vitally important because of the next point.I personally think one reason in the doubt concerning our Heavenly Father &apos;s existence is his communication with man sometimes being overlooked . Yes He could , in a booming voice , speak to all nations and there would be none left with excuse ( believe it or not , that day is coming ) . However , instead He calls Holy and True Prophets such as the ones we read of in the Holy Bible . If He had ever called a Prophet , he will continue to call Prophets . There is a true Prophet of God on earth today . No , not the kind that mutter blabberings in downtown New York , or the kind that make people drink purple koolaid . There are , and have been , many prophets that have led souls unto God and to His will ; which is to trust in Him ( in word , and ACTION &#91; Faith &#93; ) , to come to know His begotten son Jesus Christ , to repent ( change , turn from sin or unjustice ) , to pray to Him , and follow the path that would lead back to His presence and to receive as a &quot; ... joint heir with Christ ... &quot; ( Rom 8 : 16 ) The implication of Gods existence is this : if we believe in God means we must allow Him to become involved in our lives , changing it , giving specific commandments , approving or disapproving . While He that believes not , keeps God distant ; &quot; out of their Hair &quot; . Forget everything I &apos;ve said , kneel down right now and ask God , our Heavenly Father , out loud , if he exists and what you &apos;d do differently if He did . I promise you that if you ask with Trust ( you will act upon the answer He gives you ) , being sincere of Heart , He will answer you . He did for me so clearly and far beyond sight that I am left with no doubt . Thats the test ; far better that seeking an answer from man . Because those answers change ; He remains constant . If he does remain constant , thats another important implication for you . Boy , do I get excited about this topic . Just try the experiment , let God enter .
&quot; Science does not busy itself with disproving * anything * . &quot; Well , since God , by nature , would be and certainly is outside of the laws of physics , he would be difficult to disprove . But to your point , your non-interest in attempting to disprove God , is no evidence He doesn &apos;t exist . I would rather point out that your inability to prove the origin of life , the origin or very nature of the universe , the irrational behavior of forces in the universe that lead us to flip-flop on our publicly held opinions regarding &quot; the beginning &quot; - these at least leave a door open to the possibility that someone else is in charge . For those of us who have personal proof- that is enough for us . For those of you who are unable to come up with other rational answers , I recommend you at least open up your mind to the possibility that man &apos;s foolishness is the wisdom of God .
Actually , God described a round earth in the Old Testiment , but man later put upon religion ( not truth ) , that the earth was flat . Why would you assume that a simple understanding of some of the forces of nature disproves God &apos;s existance ? We still don &apos;t know much . We discover new vitamins each year , we argue global warming ( now safely named &quot; climate change &quot; because of the cooler past 10 years ) , we struggle over dark matter theories and time / space challenges ... what makes us think we can rule out God when we don &apos;t understand . You claim that science has always found evidence . I politely disagree . I believe there is much more we don &apos;t know than what we assume we know . The latest theory of the universe is that our section of universe exists in a time-space bubble , different from the rest of all that exists . This would explain the behavior of forces we can &apos;t understand , as though we are seeing through a &quot; glass , dimly &quot; . Apparently , the scientists biggest problem with this otherwise plauable explaination is that it would mean that the earth , and our portion of the universe are truly special , unique . I guess that this scientific theory would come close to saying that it may be as God said after all . ( not that any understanding of the universe is contrary to an understanding of God ) . But I call that biased science . You don &apos;t really think we know it all , do you ?
Thanks pbeaird for affirming this tested presumption . Antony Garrard Newton Flew calls it the presumption of agnosticism &#91; before his dotage &#93; . It is a procdedure , a heuristic device.Those non-observations affirm the ignostic-Ockham challenges that either God is fatuous or unartfully redundant , contrary to Alister McGrath . Yes , that extra action means resorting to convoluted ad hoc assumptions , greater than what one was to explain ! Yes , there can be no presumption of supernaturalism- Alvin Platinga &apos;s warrant for God as a basic belief . That presumption is the pareidolia- like seeing Yeshua in a tortilla- of seeing a caring , Super Mind behind Existence . That pareidolia is then a mere feeling without substance . Presumption is what one starts with , so one perforce has to start with the naturalist one ! One has to employ those observations , accept other minds and the external world and trust in ones mind from trial and error , contrary to C.Lewis and Alvin Platinga argument from reason &#91; a teleological argument &#93; as basic. pbeaird , again thanks . Please come over to Amazon religious discussions !
Each must search this answer on their own . That is the nature of faith , and the evidence of the truth that is given to seekers . I wish with all my heart that I could give you my faith- but each must find that on their own . Many can testify of the existence of God . But I understand your questions about the variety of belief systems and the confusion over whether or not God can be known . I have to say that personally ( I believed at one time that there was truth in all religions ) , I never knew God until I got saved and met Jesus Christ . I knew He existed- I just didn &apos;t know Him . In your search , you might find it helpful to ask those of the various religions you know about their relationship with God , and ask them to describe how well they know God . I believe you will find that your Christian friends have deep and personal interactions with their creator , while others follow human leaders and a bunch of rules in the hopes of someday coming close to God . God bless you
I cannot prove conclusively that God exists in a laboratory . However , the key to the Super Natural is &quot; Faith &quot; . However , there is some evidence . I can pass on to you that the Bible has survived for centuries and the most widely read text . The world uses the current Calendar based on Christ &apos;s death ( A.D. - After Death ) . We refer to B.C. ( Before Christ ) , as well . Now why must it be Faith in order to &quot; see &quot; proof ? When Christ walked the Earth he performed various miracles and people saw and people hated him . There were those , I &apos;m sure that thought it was fake . I have experienced many things that I knew God sent to me . God does most of His works through people and events for His Children . Just as God feeds the animals He takes care of His own that &quot; believe &quot; in Him . God does not want robots to love Him and God gave man the ability to chose , either good or bad . So you wonder why there is so much despair , hate , murder and abuse in the world . Why ? because God gave man a choice . Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed because of their crimes against each other . We as Humans are so quick to dismiss God because we think &quot; I can &apos;t be happy &quot; . Then there are those that just don &apos;t believe at all . I also find people can get angry if someone talks about God or Jesus . It is if they are about to catch on fire or something . I think they believe that they cannot be happy . Actually it is evil which whispers in their ear . Even I from time to time am tempted . I leave with you this poem as given to me from God . It had taken me a week to write it . I wrote the first half and when I tried to finish I felt very ill . But nonetheless I did finish . I am merely the writer and not the Author.BLINDOh the pursuits of the flesh This shell that covers self The fix of desire until the next craveSo shallow this fix , never to last Brief satisfaction ; my cup now empty This flesh aches between each thirstDay after day the endless search ; cup in hand What elixir will fill this cup and empty not The sweet savor that quenches my desireLight begins to dim on this ragged shell This flesh shriveled from the tick of time Cup after cup filled up ; folly for the foolThe spirit lay bleached to bone white Picked clean from neglect Left to rot in the hot desert wind of lifeThe spirit left alone , forgotten and unwanted Never watered or nurtured ; void of light Cast to the shadows to wither on the vineOh what a wasteland that I made of this spirit For it is I , the spirit , that was starved until death A lifetime to quicken my spirit has cost me the prize
Faith cost nothing it is the GIFT of GOD , you do nothing but get out of it &apos;s way &amp; allow yourself to be used for a purpose .. You are salvaged from a life of eternal torment but you live to a life of eternal reward.YOU are salvaged for the purpose of becomming GOD like in character &amp; IMAGE , RESTORED to how GOD made man originally ... YOU will do as HE would do .. REPRESENTATION is your purpose in eternity &amp; in the here &amp; now ..
For FAITH to exist GOD must exist ... The human heart , as we all know , is despirately wicked &amp; totally without a means of control , outside of fear from law &amp; retribution from the law ... Mankind would not make up an outside influence to dominate the human mind .. FAITH brought to fruition , yields un-human capabillities &amp; anyone who is truthfull in the matter can see by this evidence , ( that man would not go against himself to his own demise or subjection ) , in essence self-representation &amp; self-preservation .. True &quot; faith &quot; comes only from GOD by way of a change in a man &apos;s heart because of an outside force acting on that heart , heart being a person &apos;s inner makeup that has to manifest outwardly , that change .. FAITH in GOD is the very evidence that GOD exists .. IT goes against ALL human nature &amp; behavior to submit to a higher authority .. GOD is love , not a man-made mind control option , LOVE , being HIS character shown to mankind in CHRIST &apos;s manifestation .. IT is this IMAGE from which mankind originally fell .. WE were created in GOD &apos;s IMAGE .. NOT physically but in HIS CHARACTER image .. Since the fall we must be restored to that IMAGE as this is neccessary for GOD to remain GOD .. SATAN is trying his best to defeat GOD in this purpose in-order to discredit GOD in HIS eternal realm .. YOU are either helping SATAN or helping GOD in this eternal struggle ... Though GOD does not need your help , HE has appointed a purpose &amp; portion for those who receive HIM &amp; want to accept HIS IMAGE , &quot; LOVE &quot; .. The anti-christ will force anyone else to worship his image , &quot; SELF &quot; in that day of decission .. There will be NO escape from CHOICE that day &amp; ALL fates will be sealed for eternity ... IT is purposed that EVERY knee shall bow &amp; EVERY tongue confess that CHRIST is LORD over ALL , through eternity .. After all he created it all ...
The major question is why is this even a question ? It because if there is a God , faith must have a purpose that nothing else could accomplish--and indeed it does . Faith is the ultimate value upon which all relationships prosper or fail . I have faith in my bank that they can be trusted with my money ; and they trust me with a check book . Our relationship continues on the basis of that mutual trust . That trust is it own reward . If we want God &apos;s benefits , it &apos;s only consistent with all other things in life that he should ask us to accept him by faith . He has offered himself as the reward of the one who will seek to know him by faith . It &apos;s a fair deal , and a very good one . No one is forced in . And he isn &apos;t trying to fill heaven by coercion . It &apos;s for the willing.Lately , the thing which has me awestruck is God &apos;s love of paradox ( apparent contradictions that seem impossible , yet with a change of viewpoint , they resolve ) . The resurrection accounts ( Mt . 28 , Mk . 16 , Lk . 24 , Jn . 20,21 , Acts 1 : 1-12 , and 1 Cor . 15 : 3-8 appear contradictory when merely compared side-by-side , but when the events described by each of the five writers are broken into pieces they can all be brought together to form one complete story , without contradiction . Who but God could conceive such a grand puzzle ? Find out more at www.easteranswer.com
He &apos;s definitly not the God of the bible . I have trouble believing that our earth just happened , along with all the rest of humanity . What I don &apos;t understand is how God created the human race and then destroyed the entire human race . Then allowed it to flourish again , and now all of us who don &apos;t accept Jesus into our hearts will go to hell . Wait a minute isn &apos;t he all knowing , didn &apos;t he know what was going to happen when he originally created me . He loves me so much he sent his son to die on the cross for me so my sins could be forgiven but ... he made me this way and he knew it was going to turn out this way before I was born . If I don &apos;t believe in him he knows my heart and he &apos;ll judge me accordingly .
I agree with you . Have you ever considered that the delusion of Revelations is referring to the homosexual movement ? Have you ever considered that we are in the end times ? I love God . Its obvious you do too . Peace to you . My story at WWW.HOPE7.HIGHPOWERSITES.COMEverything in life is progressing just as it should . I have peace and trust in God , no matter . The bottom line question is not do you believe there is a God , God says all men / woman know it whether they wish to acknowledge is it another matter , but the real question is DO YOU LOVE HIM ? I think you do !
There is only one God but what is God ?
There are many gods of this world.But one true GOD Yahweh ! Jehovh GOD !
Countryboy is right . G-d very clearly talks about other Gods , usually Baal . We don &apos;t like Ba &apos;al . There are supposed to be other Gods out there who are very powerful supernatural beings--Zeus , Ra , Gozer , etc . But Yahweh , the Jewish G-d , is supposed to be the one who created the universe and sort of maintains it . Different levels . Like , other Gods are players on football teams , but Yahweh is the high commissioner who decides who plays , when and where .
It is philosophically , logically and scientifically impossible to prove that God exists or does not , for the following reasons : 1 ) A supreme Being is totally perfect therefore cannot be measured , defined or even &quot; sampled &quot; as per the scientific method , but if we could ... 2 ) God , if he or she exists , is above dimensional space and time ( metaphysical ) therefore being above and beyond our capacity to understand or even interpet any supposed &quot; meausrements &quot; or information we could obtain using scientific analysis.In other words we wouldn &apos;t be able to understand or inerpret any evidence for God , even if we had some that was scientifically valid.3 ) We cannot , by definition ever understand or know The First Cause ( God ) because we are only capable of anthropomorphizing any Creator or Force that is metaphysically beyond us . In other words , we give a Divine Supreme Being characteristics that are entirely human such as emotions : anger , jealousy , pity , and physical attributes .
What if He ( the First Cause , as you put it ) anthropomorphized himself for us ? So we could understand him ?
According to Christians , God did become man , in an understandable , historically provable and recognizable form ( Jesus ) , thus anthropormophizing Himself totally . However , it doesn`t help us to prove His existence since proving Jesus was God ( or the son of God ) is still beyond our abilities .
Jesus is a character in a story that attempts to show what God would do if he was a man IMHO.Did he ever really exist ? There is no proof you can CHOOSE to believe He did or you can choose to believe he didn &apos;t . To me it is irrelevant based on my only now exists post . He does exist now for me however . Based on the words and actions attributed to this character and my understanding of the teachings attributed to him he is a reality and part of my way of thinking.John says it so well , In the beginning was the WORD our first awaremess of the concept of TRUTH and the word became flesh and dwelt among men.Jesus represents the Truth of God . Which he synthesized from the ten commandments each of which represented one of these two concepts from Jesus.1. Love truth and righteousness above all else.2. Love others.William Booth the founder of the salvation army was forced to synthesize it even further when asked what ONE word would he leave to his followers . The word was not God , the word was not Jesus , The word was not even Love . The one word he left was the word OTHERS ! Because the truth is in order to have peace and understanding we really need to think about OTHERS and not be selfish .
You make the assumption that God created matter and therefore created the universe . Have you ever considered the idea that God simply organized existing matter to form ( not create ) the universe ? Your assumption does not hold for all faiths .
Why is that answer clear ? Seems to raise more questions than answer them .
Since when is science the absolute definitive ? Science has , indeed , proved itself wrong time and time again . Is omniscience part of the human condition ? Science is a human-created and pursued enterprise and scientists that we trust will be the first to tell you that they are NOT omniscient . We are limited by our own humanity . Scientists will also tell you that their art is lacking in final proofs and that their best endeavors are based upon theories that are suspect . Why investigate anything that is absolutely proven ? We are limited to the observations of our five senses and the tools that we use to enhance those senses . Who makes the tools that enhance ? Is the tool any better than the toolmaker ? Please do NOT depend upon science to provide a TRUE answer to your questions . The practitioners of science are as likely as not to give you a different answer tomorrow as they have given you today . That is the root of their quest and the ever-appealing and ever-elusive goal of their profession .
I never said science is the definitive measure ... it is one of many humanity possesses , perhaps being the least among these . However it would really move our knowledge of the Divine forward if we could get some tangible proof of His existence . My point is that it is logically impossible to ever do so .
.. the fact that yourargument states that the universe didn &apos;t exist in the potency of a former state to become this one . Nice that you think that , but it &apos;s seems presumptuous. makes me wonder , do you possess and t-shirts with a large capital A on it ? A the scene of an accident , you can rush forward rip off your buttoned up shirt and proclaim .. &apos; if he / she dies , that &apos;s the end of the road .. &apos; back to the point , ( i really think an accompanied video with you blowing bubbles could have added some ground to your argument . ) I think the most direct and clear paradox of life is .. the lack of entropy . The perpetual state of dynamics , of life. in the very universe itself . I don &apos;t think you &apos;ve ever considered that . I think it &apos;s the most blatantly profound truth in existence . With our limited understanding of physical science , this is an impossibility . So this big mysterious factor even fits with your terms , so one must conclude the likely hood that your conclusion is absolutely wrong . Our sceince says something had to do it. brain waves , the fabric of time , ... we have a lot we don &apos;t understand .. but evidently there is a something. ever dream of something that didn &apos;t happen yet ? happens to people everyday. apparently , the physical world is just scratching the surface to reality. now consider the reality of metaphysical ideas . These ideas , being substantial .. now do things make more sense ?
In the first place there has to be a first cause . We have to start somewhere . In science this is called the Unified Force . Since energy can neither be created nor destroyed it is infinite . Science also teaches that it is beyond direct observation so it is unknowable . So the Unified Force splits into the Strong Force , the Weak Force and Electromagnetism , creating the Universe.There are then two questions . First , what is the difference between the Unified Force and God ? In both cases we have an infinite , unknowable force creating the Universe . Second , what caused the Unified Force to break itself apart ?
First of all the Unified Force is the same as God . For you to treat God just as some anthropomorphic straw man that you can knock down is just silly .
I fail to see where I have anthropomorphized anything . I have simply said that the Unified Force / God is the infinite , unknowable force that created the universe . At this point the question is not Christian theology but whether there is a God . One thing at a time .
God is , always has been , and always will be . That &apos;s a hard thing to wrap your mind around , but if we didn &apos;t dwell in a finite mindset , it would not be . Many of the same people , who reject God , or Creator , can easily phantom infinite parallel universes , intelligent beings from other planets or even galaxies , but not a Creator . For me , God has always been the only plausible explanation for life . If you really study the Bible , you &apos;ll find that it must be divinely inspired if only because of the obvious logical sequence obtained by so many authors over so many years . For me , however , I only have to look at a child or maybe something as small as a butterfly , to see the handiwork of God .
are just men who are fooled into thinking that there awaits a place one in heaven , one in hell , where all will be ascribed toward infinity , where those who have chosen Christ will be reunited with their loved ones and those who have denied Him will be eternally seperated from all that is good in life . If the atheists are right , and I dont beleive they are , then I wonder if these songs would ever have been writen , I wonder if these men would have lost their minds without this hope , I wonder how many have been saved because these men dared to beleive in Gd ? Amazing Grace by John Newton- Who was a murderous , drunken , immoral slave trader and captain of a slave ship . Who had been raised to know Gd but after his mothers death lost sight of Gd . His life is so wretched and brutal that not even his own crew liked him . And then one day he came across some literature on Jesus and remembered ! A storm came up , like none hed ever seen before , and in the midst of that storm cried out to Gd and PTL Gd heard him ! ! He gave up slave trading and became a minister . Hallelujah ! What a Friend we have in Jesus by a man from Ireland who later moved to Canada , named Joseph Scriven . Joseph lost his first bride the day before their wedding when she was drowned in a tragic accident . He lost his second wife to pneumonia . He devoted his whole life to being the good samaritan and doing good works for others , he never accepted money for his charity.Silent Night a Catholic priest in Austria named Joseph Mohr . His story is also quite moving.It is well with my soul by a man from Chicago Illinois named Horatio Gates Spafford . I saved this one for last because he is my favorite one ! He lost his only son to a childhood disease . He lost his business real estates in the great Chicago fire . He was a friend to Moody and was going to England to help in the great revival happening in England but was called back at the last minute and his wife and four daughters went ahead . The boat was rammed by another boat and sank . He lost all four daughters in the ocean . His wife was rescued and sent him a telegram that said , SAVED ALONE . When he went to join her he penned this song on the boat trip there . This is why I know that Gd loves us even when tragedy strikes and we have a faith that no tragedy can take from us , the hope of glory , the hope of eternal life through the blood of the lamb Jesus . I too can say , IT IS WELL WITH MY SOUL . My prayer is that my children will all be able to say that no matter the .. quoteWhen peace , like a river , attendeth my way , When sorrows like sea billows roll ; Whatever my lot , Thou has taught me to say , It is well , it is well , with my soul ... Though Satan should buffet , though trials should come , Let this blest assurance control , That Christ has regarded my helpless estate , And hath shed His own blood for my soul.AMEN. We are blessed in Jesus .
Science deals only with the creation . It cannot deal with the creator because the creator exists outside the box of creation that science is trapped within.The best science can do is say once there was a &quot; big bang &quot; , something happened and a bunch of energy exploded into what we know as reality and cooled and formed the universe and created laws of physics that we have discovered.Science cannot tell us what went bang nor why it went bang .
Flying Spaghetti monsters make no sense , the possible existence of a Creator and speculation on ITS nature makes sense . Equating God.s existence to fantastical creations of the irrational is poor argumentation . Because we cannot prove a negative does not mean that , within the Laws of Nature and Physics , there is no God per se . We will never know for sure so atheists hold to the No hypothesis . Maybe we should all be agnostics ... we simply do not know nor will we ever know .
Athiest man is not profound wisdom . To say to a person that there is the here and now .. it needs not be said . To see if you are humble and honest , and wise. those are substantial . Those elements are profound . How they would not exist without the greater essence. that is profound. blessed are those who believed and did not see .
Are you kidding me ? Does that mean that PLuto did not exist until science discovered it ? Come on that is just silly . Of course the agnostic position should be the null position , because we just don &apos;t know.But I am on the yes side because I have defined God in such a way as to be quite confident of Gods existence not as a physical entity but as a spirit of truth and righteousness
Science is an hypothesis as well . It is based on the perception that the universe is limited to what we can sense with our 5 senses and instrumentation designed to augment those five senses.Right now there are thousands of radio and tv and wireless signals going past my head but I cant see or hear or even feel them because i dont have the receiver turned on or tuned to the proper frequency . But regardless of that those signals are there . WHat else is there that I simply do not have a receiver for or am not tuned into . Is there a &quot; spirit of truth and righteousness &quot; that requires a mind that can receive it and a mind that is tuned into the frequency it broadcasts on ? Many people have a &quot; gut feeling &quot; about what is right and wrong , where does it come from . Last nights Spaghetti : - ) Or is there a &quot; spirit of truth and righteousness &quot; is there a concious or subconcious concience that is more than just what we have reasoned from our life experience to be the correct thing to do . We are really good at justifying what we some how know is wrong . IMHO
They cannot be proven to exist if 1 . You do not have instrumentation that can detect them and and relay that information in a manner that our 5 senses can sense them.2. If you do not have that instrumentation tuned into the frequency those energy signals are transmitting on . 3 . There may be many other energy waves than radio tv infra red ultra violet light rays . Thought waves for example , we cannot even read thought waves who , who knows what other energy signals are out there that we simply cannot detect withn our current detection facilities.Just because you don &apos;t know its there does not mean it doesn &apos;t exist .
You said , &quot; we would need ample evidence that the laws of physics have been broken or at least horribly misunderstood . However , we have none . &quot; The so called definitions of the laws of physics as man understands them are researched and refined every day at universities all over the world . People are still receiving PhDs and grants , so yes , there is ample proof that our understanding of physics is still being refined . Every single day .
No need to attack . When you say things like &quot; You are seriously misinformed about the nature of scientific knowledge . &quot; then you lose a civilized debate . Debate the topic , not the person.I agree with you on most of your points about what science and research are . I &apos;m an engineer , not a scientist , if you care to draw a distinction . So , I know science changes when consensus changes . God &apos;s laws of nature don &apos;t change , but the human understanding of those laws changes via peer review . No need to go back to Aristotle . Just go pull some textbooks off the shelf from the 1930s.Yes , conservation of mass and energy are not up for debate here . This debate is about God . He is free to violate any law of physics he wants , since he created them in the first place . Look at the elegance of the universe . How could that have happened by accident ? Also , if we hold to the fact of conservation of mass and energy , then how did the big bang happen ? Faith and Science are two very different things . God created the laws of nature that we call Science . No doubt , he has violated them a few times as serves his purpose . God also created the faith that humans must exercise in order to understand a bit more of him each day .
Had the law been violated , then one might invoke Him but then one would still be saying fatuity as He is so incoherent as His properties so contradict each other as we ignostics so loudly proclaim . The law is perpetual : the present is key to the past . One should always look for natural causes and explanations as that is our experience that makes for the presumption of naturalism . They are despite Leibniz the sufficient reason . Ex nihilo is fatuous as it is contrary to experience and to posit nothingness is to posit nothing whatsoevr as knowledge . See Peter A.Angeles &quot; The Problem of God : a Short Introduction . &quot; The occult adds nothing to knowledge ! As atheologian Keith Parsons notes , it merely invokes the fig leaf of ignarnce .
therefore , there cannot be absolute ...
The universe cannot be infinetly old , according to my very limited knowledge , because heat flows from warm to cold bodies . If the universe has always existed , everything should be the same temperature . Where am I wrong ?
This universe hasn &apos;t always existed . It had a beginning and it will cease to exist when it reaches absolute zero unless something changes .
If the laws of physics apply then why is matter destroyed in a Black Hole ? I think there is a God and I have no idea why He created you .
It &apos;s mass can not be created or destroyed not matter . Energy has mass . Get the science right .
I can make no more sence out of science then you can make out of religion . Well , maybe a little .
I understand enough to know that you are twisting it to support your anti-religious attitudes . Why do you make judgments on religious ideas you have no understanding of ?
&quot; The existence of a god would invalidate the most essential laws of science ... &quot; An interesting argument indeed . Why does science have laws ? Why do we accept that there is a natural order ( design ? ) . Why is it an accepted proposition that those laws can be depended upon ? If I were to believe in a designer , I would expect a design . I would expect that the universe he created would have evidence of his design . If I were to take your side of the argument I would wonder why any laws or formulas would exist at all ? You are speaking out of both sides of your mouth- arguing from the perspective of a highly ordered universe out of the one side , and denying the source of that order out of the other . If the universe has laws as you say , then you must be intellectually honest enough to say that those laws had to come from somewhere .
Who says the Creator of all those laws is bound by them ?
Just how do you explain faith to the faithless . Our faith in our states that faith is not brought on to another by us . As Jesus stated , &quot; The Father calls them on to me &quot; . Mans faith in himself blinds him to faith in God . Outside of Christianity all other faiths are forms of humanism , just as science is . Are evening and morning news cycles are filled with endless news stories of scientists have done this or that study , or experts suggest this or that . Only later to conclude the opposite may be true . This is the problem with modern day politics , liberalism has basically come to the conclusion of &quot; This is ok for this moment &quot; . With God nothing changes .
The very exsistence of matter invalidates the law of physics . There should be nothing because matter cannot be made or destroyed , only changed if I am to understand your argument correctly . It &apos;s amazing how well the Bible is formed , there are no incostencies in it . You just displayed why man made religion is easy to spot , because it will have glaring incosistancies in it .
We could blog here all night and all day for years on end and it comes down to this simple conclusion : Atheists believe God does not exist , they are putting their money down on no eternal life . Their payoff they believe is humans living in reality while alive for their short time here on Earth . Here is their problem , what if God does exist ? They have basically doomed themselves , its their payoff they have been afforded all the information of Christ and have decided that it is mere folly.Christians on the other hand have taken the 50 / 50 bet . If God doesn &apos;t exist they have lived in a fairy tale land for the last 25-50 to 75 years . But given their religions good precepts they have at the least lived a decent and kind life . But then comes the payoff , He does exist , they reap the rewards of their faith and achieve eternal life.I &apos;ll take the later . There are no lasting payoffs for Atheism . I &apos;d rather not pay a huge price for the honor of science and theories . What if the atheists theories are nothing really more then explaining God ? Isn &apos;t that what the weatherman on TV does every night . Everything explained by Scientists could be nothing more then a play-by-play of God . Simply put scientists are nothing more then the Vin Scully &apos;s of their field
I cannot prove conclusively that God exists in a laboratory . However , the key to the Super Natural is &quot; Faith &quot; . However , there is some evidence . I can pass on to you that the Bible has survived for centuries and the most widely read text . The world uses the current Calendar based on Christ &apos;s death ( A.D. - After Death ) . We refer to B.C. ( Before Christ ) , as well . Now why must it be Faith in order to &quot; see &quot; proof ? When Christ walked the Earth he performed various miracles and people saw and people hated him . There were those , I &apos;m sure that thought it was fake . I have experienced many things that I knew God sent to me . God does most of His works through people and events for His Children . Just as God feeds the animals He takes care of His own that &quot; believe &quot; in Him . God does not want robots to love Him and God gave man the ability to chose , either good or bad . So you wonder why there is so much despair , hate , murder and abuse in the world . Why ? because God gave man a choice . Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed because of their crimes against each other . We as Humans are so quick to dismiss God because we think &quot; I can &apos;t be happy &quot; . Then there are those that just don &apos;t believe at all . I also find people can get angry if someone talks about God or Jesus . It is if they are about to catch on fire or something . I think they believe that they cannot be happy . Actually it is evil which whispers in their ear . Even I from time to time am tempted . I leave with you this poem as given to me from God . It had taken me a week to write it . I wrote the first half and when I tried to finish I felt very ill . But nonetheless I did finish . I am merely the writer and not the Author.BLIND Oh the pursuits of the flesh This shell that covers self The fix of desire until the next crave So shallow this fix , never to last Brief satisfaction ; my cup now empty This flesh aches between each thirst Day after day the endless search ; cup in hand What elixir will fill this cup and empty not The sweet savor that quenches my desire Light begins to dim on this ragged shell This flesh shriveled from the tick of time Cup after cup filled up ; folly for the fool The spirit lay bleached to bone white Picked clean from neglect Left to rot in the hot desert wind of life The spirit left alone , forgotten and unwanted Never watered or nurtured ; void of light Cast to the shadows to wither on the vine Oh what a wasteland that I made of this spirit For it is I , the spirit , that was starved until death A lifetime to quicken my spirit has cost me the prize
If you gain , you gain all . If you lose , you lose nothing . Wager then , without hesitation , that He exists.--Blaise Pascaland to be honest it seems it would take just as much faith to believe that there is no God , that when we die were done and gone , as it does to believe in one . The reason why people have always come up with different religions and theories is yes , to search out an explanation of the universe and its contents . But , instead of seeing this as a pathetic foolishness that you seem to , it appears to me that it is the amazing inborn reactions humans have to discover where they have come from , where they go to , and why they are here . Perhaps we feel we have to find answers to these questions because somewhere we know that there &apos;s more to this life .
&quot; This is your fundamental failure in all the arguments provided , which means , in essence , all of your arguments fail &quot; LOL . Wow . Did anyone else take a second read at that ?
I applaud your honesty . Science is not what is or isn &apos;t , but instead what might or might not be . Science explanation does not have to be true to be useful , just consistent with most of the evidence . How much of science has been disapproved with new technologies . I mean look how much of Darwin has been disputed as inaccurate , thanks to molecular Biology . Follow the evidence , make a decision . I would encourage you as a seemingly logical scientist to study more on Robert Collins Fine Tuning , Michael Behe , Jonathan Wells ( molecular Biology ) , and David Berlinski . Good life to you
&quot; We want there to be a god , but in order for a god to be real , everything we know about science would have to be wrong . &quot; This is simply a restatement of the previous argument , which is nothing more than an unsupported assertion . There is no reason to suppose that science would have to be dropped if God is real . Indeed , modern science exists precisely because early scientists believed in God . They believed that the world , and by extension the universe , was rational , ordered and knowable precisely because God created it that way.One may well reject the idea of God but the ( non ) argument above does not provide support for doing so .
That is no unsupported assertion , goodwyne , as the evidence supports it : were matters different that the laws work in helter-skelter manner , then one might posit God as Victor Stenger notes in &quot; Has Science found God &quot; and &quot; God : the failed Hypothesis . &quot; One engages in a petitio in finding God to sustain Existence . It was not necessary that those scientists thought Him making the &quot; Comprehensible Universe &#91; Stenger &#93; . &quot;
What you &apos;ve done is set up a straw man and knocked him down . You basically assert , with no support , that if there is a God , &quot; laws would work in a helter skelter manner . There simply is no rational support for such an assertion . Therefore , you &apos;re presented nothing but an assertion , certainly not an argument . I stand by my statement .
goodwyne , nay , we have no reason to doubt that the laws work , so one would have to demonstrate evidence that some occult force could overcome them- no straw man at all . If one could , then they were in a helter- skelter manner . One would have to show the impossible that the law of conservation did not hold before the Big Bang , which by the way depends on that law as portraying quantum energy before the Bang , whence it came . The weight of evidence from experience is that natural laws and causes and explanations are the sufficient reason.To posit God is the unimformative and fatuous , God did it ! pbeaird might enlighten you further .
Hitler tried to make facts by repeating them enough times . Don &apos;t fall for this weakness in the human condition . Natural selection is not Evolution . Intelligent design is simply a phrase made up by men , it isn &apos;t in the Bible . However , the Bible does tell us to observe all that God has made . Do that , then decide for yourself if it is an accident .
The weight of evidence since the big bang has nothing to say about conditions before the big bang . What laws governed are the subject of mere speculation . There simply is no experience and no empirical evidence from which to draw conclusions.As for laws as we know them , no one has claimed that we should doubt them . Certainly the possibility of a God does not preclude them fron functioning just as we expect them to.We could go back and forth with a &quot; yes you are &quot; - &quot; no I &apos;m not &quot; conversation but that serves no purpose . Baring anything that actually supports the position that a God would invalidate all physical laws , I don &apos;t think there &apos;s much more to discuss .
You seem to be forgetting that current evolutionary theory also breaks the laws of physics . It requires life to spontaneously arise from non-life , which , according to science is impossible . It would make more sense to have a being who could break the laws of physics willy nilly ( though that is not what I , nor many others , believe is the case ) than it would to have the laws of physics randomly break themselves .
of course they would say that science has been proven. whoever wrote this had to have been full of a lot of hubris in order to publish it. science isnt PROVEN. for the love of any superior being , were NEVER going to have all the answers. don &apos;t use the term science and proven in the same fragment. end of story .
You have made an elementary statement in , &quot; Science has been proven . &quot; That statement is similar to the following , &quot; The Sun has been proven . &quot; The question is , what about the sun is proven ? upon your statement i ask the following : 1 ) Which science ? - there are many types of study.2 ) Which has been proven ? - there are many differing ideas on a range of topics .
that &apos;s not quite accurate . First of all , the unified force isn &apos;t really a thing . You might be talking about a Unified field , which is a description of how strong nuclear forces , weak nuclear forces , electromagnetism and gravity interact and are similar . That would give us the ability to say for certain how everything is going to move , but doesn &apos;t really give us much in the way of how the universe was created.And it &apos;s not true to say that we cannot know what that unified force is , but that we don &apos;t currently know . That &apos;s why we &apos;re looking .
Believers have faith . The Bible is clear that faith is required . However , these citations claiming to disprove The Bible are false . Saying The Bible is wildly inaccurate a few hundred times and getting others to site the statement , doesn &apos;t make it true.There are plenty of archeological and historical correlations to stories presented in The Bible .
the only way we know it exists is because of the impact it has on space around it .... much like Gd and satan ! http : / / www.space.com / blackholes /
God doesn &apos;t hate you .
i think this science you so much trustv in is just a humanly way of understanding whats around us ang it is a way of getting around the truth , but God loves u all anyways : )
Exactly ! This is a fabulous OBSERVATION . But that &apos;s all it is . Many people look at the sun everyday , and many people see it differently , but does that mean it doesn &apos;t exist ? No . In fact , the very existence of so many views seems to make it more likely , more probable , and more believable that God exists . There are many different points of view on what government ought to be , but this observation does not mean that government doesn &apos;t exist . I agree completely with the observation , but that &apos;s all it is . It fails to function as an argument , and therefore cannot be valued as such in evaluatin the existence of God . In fact , this argument is much more easily turned into a theistic argument .
Fellow naturalist , it is so true about that burden . Now I do ever try to reflect nature not needing God to direct or sustain it . Faith is not a warrant for belief , contrary to Alvin Platinga , as it is just the we just say so of credullity . It begs the question of God as there is indeed no evidence whatsoever for Him . With Sydney Hook , we naturalist find that science is acquired knowledge while faith begs the question of being knowledge . Faith keeps believers in the darkness of superstition ! We rationalists do not have to be omniscient but to find no evidence for Him as presented and no logic in the arguments for Him .
Because many people look at a mountain at different angles , and therefore see different things does not disprove , or even make unlikely , the existence of the mountain . The fact that many people see different angles , or ideas , of what God and his function are , do not disprove , or even make unlikely , the existence of God .
First off , the mightiness of God does not at all determine his existence ; simply- no matter what God is or does , he either exists or does not , and attempting to disprove the bible &apos;s God by showing what it inherently is ( which does not disprove ) , doesn &apos;t disprove all definitions of God . This being said , we must realize that the utmost strategy of this argument is pathos . It tries to turn your emotions of wanting God to be all powerful into a conclusion for atheism . This argument completely skips logic . Logically we can see that if God exists , and he can in the framework of the bible despite these observations , then atheism is not the best answer . The argument presented here assumes omnipotence and the bible , therefore atheism . It fails to provide ANY logical warrant . It completely skips every other argument , and the simple fact that the arguments are not mutually exclusive . It therefore fails .
I believe that god is all encompassing and all around you and is a tangent because I only have a deep feeling of it and I Know It &apos;s there . I do not preach . I do not feel obliged to force religion on others . I believe god has been dragged through the mud by government officials for war . God is God
Your argument is based on a flawed conception of omnipotence.You say that God &apos;s omniscience , being all knowing , proves that God can &apos;t change things from how he knows them to be . Essentially , God can &apos;t change things to be difference from what they are . Now you say , &quot; therefore God cannot be all powerful because in contradicts his omniscience . &quot; So , your argument is essentially that God is a contradiction precisely because he cannot contradict himself . This argument is clearly logically flawed.God &apos;s omnipotence means that he can do all things that are possible . That fact that he is all powerful means that there are things that he cannot do . God cannot be wrong . God cannot make himself cease to exist . Hence , God cannot contradict himself . Your own argument is a contradiction , not God .
Your argument is logically inconsistent and bordering on incoherent . Benching 300 is NOT impossible . You just do not have the power to do it . There is a very clear and obvious difference.You are able to say things that are contradictory , ergo you are greater than a being who cannot . That is similar to saying that because you will die you are greater than an immortal being.God and human are so ontologically different that each would logically have attributes that the other does not by virtue of being opposite , i.e. immortal God and mortal man , omniscient God vs a man who can be ignorant . The nature of your argument that you are superior by virtue of your ignorance is quite silly and potentially dangerous . I &apos;m not here to attack your beliefs , you have the freedom to believe whatever you like . I &apos;m just clarifying incorrect arguments attacking mine and showing that belief in God is a rational belief and not logically inconsistent like some people try to say .

I have never understood why people cannot accept that religion and God exist simultaneously with science . Science explains how things happen , but religion seeks the explanation of why these things happen- something science will never be able to do .
Why do things happen by chance then ? Why is there randomness in the world ?
Truth is you can &apos;t prove it . Ask any scientist . Not saying it isn &apos;t a very good theory , I mean even gravity is just a theory , but it is still just a theory , not fact . Secondly , the existence of a diving being or beings does not require it to be a Christian god , or for the Bible to be anything more than a book . Furthermore , more and more scientists are beginning to say that for the universe to have occured , there would have had to have been a cause for the Big Bang . Also , while experiments have shown that in stimulations of Earth &apos;s early conditions , simple amino acids , the building blocks of life , will indeed form , statistics have demonstrated that the chances of these amino acids happening to line up in just the right way to form a protein are so small as to make it virtually impossible . This isn &apos;t opinion , it is what has been shown in experiments and calculations by real scientists . Intelligent Design is also a theory , not some mumbo jumbo . It is not an invented explaination , and it does have evidence .
Religion seeks an explanation for why things happen . Science only answers how things happen.i.e. How did the Earth form ? -Well , after billions of years the dust that composes earth eventually clumped together and condensed to form a planet . Some of this dust also made the sun.How did all of this matter come to be ? -Billions and billions of years ago , at the beginning of time , there was the Big Bang , where an extremely dense piece of matter that held every atom in the known universe- the size of a pinhead maybe . All of the energy there caused it to explode and from there , galaxies and solar systems were born.Where did the small piece of matter come from ? or Why did the Big Bang happen ? If you can logically come up with a scientific answer to this , then you are absolutely amazing . How can everything come from nothing ? Unless .... God made it ! The spiritual being that always was and always will be created everything that never was and will cease to be !
I understand how life is capable on Earth . I don &apos;t mean to boast , but I &apos;ve taken AP Physics and AP Biology , as well as a year of honors Chemistry and Honors Biology freshman year- I &apos;m well versed in the sciences ( And I hope to go into medicine or mechanics ! ) Therefore , I &apos;m fairly certain I know how there is life on Earth.But we don &apos;t know why life is here ! God always was and always will be . He is a complete enigma and a mystery to the human race . Any attempt to explain who He is and why He did the things He did is impossible .
I never said the Bible is 100 % true and science must back it . I believe the creation stories and much of the beginning of the Bible to be merely stories meant to make people understand the power and awesomeness of God , not to tell them how the Earth began . They had no idea how it began back then .
see Miller Urey and the many other experiments that deal with origins of life from inorganic material to organic material ( amino acids , etc )
Gravity is a theory . Ask any scientist . Then ask them to explain very slowly what a theory is to you . You &apos;ll be a better person for it . Also , please stop making appeals to ridicule . It is a logical fallacy , and makes you look like a jerk.Your attempt to disprove Intelligent Design using big words is infantile . It &apos;s also a logical fallacy , known as argumentum verbosium . You didn &apos;t acually disprove anything , you just said basically the same thing I said , and then denied it . You offered no evidence , you just used a lot of big technical terms and made it a lot longer than it needed to be in the hopes of confusing me . You failed . You have disproved nothing.Finally , in your persistance in stating that ID has no evidence , despite the fact that you have disproved nothing and not even attempted to disprove all of the evidence offered , you have shown yourselves to be just as close-minded as the 7-day Creationist who refuses to acknowledge evolution . Do yourself a favor , and go down to your local Community College . Enroll in two classes , one on the scientific method , and one on rhetoric . You should come away with that experience with a firm grasp on both what a scientific theory is and why both evolution and gravity are scientific theories , and how to offer up a valid argument without appealing to logical fallacies .
The beginning of time . How did it all start ? The Big Bang , right ? Okay .... Explain how the Big Bang came to be . Oh right , a very dense piece of matter exploded and created the universe . But wait , how did that piece of matter come to be ? There was nothing before it . Oh , that &apos;s right . God , the being who always was , created it , fully intending for it to explode and make the universe . Duh .
Okay , so let &apos;s say it was an accident- how did the accident come to be ? There really is no explanation for why the universe began without factoring some supernatural being.We don &apos;t need to know anything about the initial force that created the universe- that &apos;s why there are many different religions out there . We just need to understand that there was some initial force .
Went to church . In fact , he wanted to be a priest.Stop with the Hitler comparisons .
He dropped that in favor of Secular Socialism as he grew into an adult / dictator .
YES ! ! why are we always losing these things. i have aswered the debate topic. yes. i have just reaffirmed my position
The evidence of God &apos;s existence is all around us : You , Me , Life the World , the Universe . There is no way science can explain how something can just come into existence out of nothing . The Big Bang Theory ? Where did that little ball of matter that exploded come from ? How did it come to be ? There is no way to explain the existence of everything in the universe without God or some sort of higher power . In science , one has to know how to explain something , but we don &apos;t have to understand God . One must just have faith . The existence of God is what makes sense to show where everything came from , while science does not makes sense in this subject . Why did we come to be ? What causes us to have morals ? Do you really want to believe that your mind , body , spirit , and whole being are just a random collection of matter , that you mean nothing . I don &apos;t know about you , but that is such a grim thought to me .
ask yourself , how did humans existed in this world ? It is very impossible that without any creator , people would exist in this world . A pair of cells is needed in order to produce a new living thing .
i believe in god so i won &apos;t go to hell ^ . ^
of course . Looking around us we see things that cant be explained away by futile theories created by people to fill the void in their life.Take Yellowstone . Travel there , walk around and tell me if it takes more faith to believe that it was a random act of evolution or a planned act of an all-powerful God .
I &apos;ll put it this way , Life to exist without a deity of some sort ( I personally belive it is my Father in Heaven but I &apos;ll debate that some other time ) is near impossible , for example , a species is now defined as a group of organisms that can succesfully breed and create fertile offspring in the wild , so if , let &apos;s say , a homo habilis once did evolve from a homo erectus , the chances of just one evolving is near zero , but since species cannot breed out of species then how would humans evolve and populate the earth ?
You can &apos;t convince a group to hate people who are different when you are different . Hitler was evil , yes , but also intelligent . Once he was in power and had the Germans firmly united behind him , he quickly phased out that pesky Christianity business . If you accuse some one of being like Hitler based on his brief stint as a Christian , you can say make the comparison to just about anyone . He was a man , for example , and a veteran , he was Austrian , and he even happened to be part Jewish . Do you really want to say that all men , veterans , and anyone who is part Jewish are like Hitler ?
of course he is just have faith it will help you in the end i hope you people who say no dont burn i shall pray 4 u so ok
Yes , i do . I used to ponder upon the idea of there not being a God , but now im sure will all my heart that there is a God . No matter waht anyone else says .
Well for those of you who believe in the big bang theory where the Earth was cereated by an explosion of gases and other stuff , I ask you this : Where did the gases come from ?
And just who do you think provided that medical team with the skills to save anothers life ? I have to say I feel sad for people who think as you do . Specious reasoning , ten dollars words won &apos;t convince me nor anyone else who has faith and hope by the grace of God that He does not exist . The text book you should be reading is the Bible . You speak of African children , why go so far from home , there are plenty of children in the states who have some of the same problems as those in Africa . Maybe just maybe if you read the bible , you would learn more about God and why things go the way that they do . Exactly what makes you so sure God doesn &apos;t help African children or any child for that matter . My niece spent two years of her life in Africa helping and teaching the very children you speak of . God comes in many forms through many people , I am sorry you feel the way that you do . It must be difficult to know what &apos;s out there walking around with blinders on all the time.If you want to know why God does what He does , why don &apos;t you go to the source and ask Him ? Have a Blessed Day .......
God is there ! ! I have myself felt that there is some power in the universe which drives us to the good path ! ! ---philip foreclosed homes
exactly . In nature there is something called synergy. that is , when two materials fused together make for a stronger ( for example ) material than the sum of the strength of the materials separately . This happens because of how they interrelate for certain mathematical forms are stronger than others . A tetrahedron is a stronger form then a box for examplehttp : / / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / File : Tetrahedron.svg different forms coming together randomly can cause huge exponential changes
I have faith and believe in miracles , and I believe in God
Yes I believe in God . I also believe in religion because I &apos;m Irish / Italian and I was raised Catholic because there was no other choice for me .... but yes , I believe there is a God .
i think so because if you dont what will you bieleve in.The minimum length for an argument is 50 characters . The purpose of this restriction is to cut down on the amount of dumb jokes , so we can keep the quality of debate and discourse as high as possible .
I believe in my god Jesus Christ , because there is proof of him being here on earth . Not because of the Bible , . Because the simple fact that explores and scientist found proof .
of course ........ god exist .... Nd the people who dnt believe that god exist dont belive on themselves ......
i believe in god , but i do not believe in man. man has twisted the idea of god to a point where people with authority in churches have mixed ideas about god .
I usually want to stay out of these types of debates , but I &apos;m voting just to get the YES ! ! side off of 666 votes ( that &apos;s just sick irony ) . Yes , I believe in God . I am a Christian , and I hate it when God and science are compared . I don &apos;t see why God couldn &apos;t have just set evolution in motion . Genisis says that God made Adam from the dirt and dust . That is exactly where the small mammals that we supposedly evolved from came from . : -o It makes you think doesn &apos;t it.Of course , everyone is entitled to their own opinions .
Yes . I am from a christian family . LIke someone else sais , science and religion sholdn &apos;t be compared . I was in a hristian school as a child and we had scinece class every day .
The Old Testament is the oldest reliable text.It has passed the three scientific tests to prove that it is reliable.Many outside sources provide proof to the accuracy of the Bible.There are many account of the flood ( Genesis 6-8 , I think )
You &apos;re forgetting that humanity means nothing . We have observed 3000 galaxies , and that &apos;s only what we &apos;ve seen . You &apos;re telling me that out of an estimated 500 billion galaxies , not to mention the possibility of there being more than one universe , that the chemical / physical reactions couldn &apos;t at least create another planet with life ? Remember that we &apos;re not even breaching the realms of other life , such as non-carbon based lifeforms- or for that matter , OTHER DIMENSIONS.Think your statement over again .
So , you are telling me that the universe was made by a bunch of gases which went boom . Then after a long process it became the Earth . Just a little question about your theory . Who made these tiny gases ? Who made life ? It would take more than just a coincidental arrangement of atoms and molecules to form a single living cell . Science does not explain life AT ALL . What happens in the afterlife ? Or , what is outside of the universe ? is it just empty space ? How far does it lead us ?
God exists . All &quot; He &quot; is , is energy . The energy that makes up everything in existance . Take THAT athiests .
Yes I do . To think we were just plunked down here out of the star lit sky when there were two moons in the sky is stretching it ! Look around at the miracles you see every day , but most of us take it for granted . There is something within each human ( even those that deny ) that has God in them ( or a Supreme Being if they so choose to call Him that ) whether they like it or not . I have seen grown men that have denied an existence of a God , but , have seen them in a hospital Chapel on bended knees praying to God to save their little girl or save a loved one . One can think there is nothing out there and it &apos;s just a belief system until the rage of a horrible incident comes into play and they &apos;re kneeling down asking for help . You simply believe or you don &apos;t . Believing is a whole lot simpler ( if you mean it ) and a lot more peaceful . I &apos;ve seen many miracles in my years on this earth. http : / / www.puretravel.com / Guide / Africa / Eastern _ Africa / tanzania
Ya know , it &apos;s psychotic attitudes like that which only goes to prove you homos are violent lunatics ! And for the record , I &apos;ve been persecuted and abused all my life by fags - just for being Christian . I remember when I was just 16 year old , a fag-lovin liberal Judge put me in prison for ATTACKED at a Gay Pride Parade . Hey , it was only blanks , and you &apos;d think they &apos;d see the funny side , but he was REAL mean about it . He even included 3 prior assault charges , an tried to say it was some sort of hate crime . He called me all sorts of hateful words , and my two boys were crying all thro &apos; the trial . It was shocking ! My whole family were in tears , but my daddy said he was real proud of me for showing those fags what for . I served 2 years for that , and had to be apart from my two sons all that time , and it hurt real bad . It still pains me that I missed so much of their childhood . Now that &apos;s TRUE persucution ! You fags wouldnt know what persecution was if it walked up , and smashed a brick into ur teeth . I was persecuted because of my faith . Because i &apos;m a Christian . Christians are always a target from God-haters . But we have to stay strong , because we can &apos;t let our Lord down and give into all this fag-rights nonsense . God said in the Bible exactly what rights fags have - NONE WHATSOEVER ! I still pray everyday that our Laws get changed to the Laws of the Bible , so that we can smite all those who God wants smited , and stone all those God wants stoned . Praise ! Until then my family will always suffer abuse from fags in the street , who know our names and follow us everywhere we go . They throw things at me and call me a psycho , and try to get me to violate my parole . Yes , we live in a small town , and Christians are always a target in that kind of enviroment from God-haters and lunatics . You talk about intolerance , well what you fags are doin to my family is intolerance , and you know it !
Ironically , I &apos;m seeing some of the same people who make the argument that we need to cut down on CO2 emmissions &quot; just in case &quot; it is causing global warming making the argument that God doens &apos;t exist . Why not read the Bible , &quot; just in case &quot; God exists ? Then after reading it and reflecting on it , make your own decision .
How can you say there is no evidence ? I suppose you believe in the Big Bang ( so do I ) . How do you suppose the Big Bang came to be ? And don &apos;t say &quot; random events &quot; . There is no way the entire Universe simply came to be without a Necessary Being . And what about miracles ? Are they just by chance ? God can be seen in so much around the world , so either you live under a rock or you just don &apos;t notice anything about how God is constantly here with us . Next time you go outside , look at the intricacy of the trees : how the branches intertwine and the colors are so vibrant . Look at the diversity of life and the delicacy of it . The balance of nature and the contrasts between night and day , alive and dead . To say there is no evidence of God is a HUGE fallacy .
you can debate faith in some regards - if someone believes god makes lightning and uses it to smite people , then we show how lightning actually works - then the person of faith can either believe their god does not exist , or is less powerful in that it no longer is responsible for lightning , or made it possible for you to discover how lightning works but also still controls it , etc.when given enough fallacies - 6000 year old earth etc a person is either left with a much weaker god that only does whatever you can &apos;t prove it didn &apos;t do ( and many claims of things that it did which you can prove unlikely ) , or no god at all .
You have bought into global warming , &quot; just in case &quot; . While there is evidence on both sides of the hypothesis , you made a statement that leaps to treating it as a fact . My point is that it is silly for people to apply the scientific method as a way to say that there isn &apos;t a God , while they turn right around and embrace fake science as fact . Darwin &apos;s stuff is still considered a theory , for instance . It is not a fact . Global warming , caused by human actions , is still a theory , not a fact . It is a fact that the earth has warmed and cooled many times in the past , without any help from mankind.Sure , please do read all the so called holy texts . I have read many of them , but won &apos;t claim to have read them all . I find that the ones I have read have common themes about loving the unlovable and generally buy into the same 10 commandments that are found in the old testament . My issue with the other texts is that all of them , except The Bible , promise a way to heaven thru some kind of action by you , a mere mortal , no further action by God being required . Only The Bible makes it clear that nobody gets to heaven unless God physically intervenes and allows it . That &apos;s the text I choose to believe since it requires the existence of God . The other texts simply don &apos;t . Yes , The Bible also clearly states that many people who read it won &apos;t believe it .
This is a poorly asked debate question . That is like me asking someone from Ireland if they even know who Vishnu or Rama is ( God of India ) . I believe that God and Jesus Christ do exist . I believe that according to my religion that what is said is true . Without a doubt I do not want to believe that when I die the screen goes black like my TV when the power goes out . That I refuse to believe , I want to think that I stand in front of the golden gates of heaven and that the doors open to me . We can look back into history and we can find flaws in the Bible . The flood that betook the Earth the flood that Noah had built an Arc for . Their are many religions that have their own excuses for the cause of that event ! Back into many ancient religions a flood was caused by the Gods ! All in all I lean like a mime into something YES i am unable to see BUT do I believe ? Yes without a doubt ! Think of a blind man , and ask him the question does the color blue really exist ?
There are large Hindu populations in Bangladesh , Maritius , Guyana , Nepal , and many other countries , so Hinduism isn &apos;t just in India .
I was not planning on using every known country that worshiped Hinduism I was making the example that I am sure there are quite a few people in the world that do not know who Vishnu is and it is safe to say that Vishnu is a god of India but better put would have been Hinduism. and just 1 question why did you say they were not ? what is the answer ? &quot; I &apos;ll give you a hint ; they &apos;re not the god / s of India . &quot;
no no no you missed the point in that part. the point was I was saying that there are flaws in the bible ... saying that there have been other accounts of floods due to different gods in different religions ... try reading a little slower = /
I do not know who Rama is but Hinduism is their main religion by I believe the numbers to be above 75 % of the population so it is safe to assume that you can say a God is of India or the other places it is worshiped make it fine to refer to that God to be of that specific place rite ? or am I off my rocker ?
Great points hats off to ya Wolfman
The ending of this is fantastic ! I never thought of it in that fashion
Good Job and analogies it really does start all from faith . Even without religion or believing in god . Having faith in things is important in life whether it relates to doing good in school getting a good job having good health overall faith in yourself . Faith that there is something better than the world life we live in .
Yes , I understand the difference between a scientific theory and a scientific fact . I have a scientific bachelor &apos;s degree and I know that scientists do &quot; make stuff up &quot; = &quot; postulate &quot; . It &apos;s the first step in the process .
If you couldn &apos;t see something that was unbelievable and absolutely ludicrous would you believe it if you couldn &apos;t see it ?
This is an impossible question to answer mainly because we really don &apos;t have the means of figuring shit like this out ... Agnostics and Science : Who the fuck knows , anything is possible at this pointChristians : Yes , because the bible says so.Atheists : No , because i &apos;ve never seen any evidence saying otherwise ( and psychics and ghosts don &apos;t exist no matter how many people claim they do ) .Buddhists : It is what it is.Nihilists : No and who gives a fuck.Satanists : No , and live your life to the fullest.Philosophers : There are a million answers to the Universe , God happens to be most of them.Politicians : CHANGE ! yep , everyone has a different answer . So far though , most people believe in God and say he does exist.So , according to about 90 % of the people in the world , yes , he does.Does it mean it &apos;s true ? no . But it does mean that &apos;s what most people will tell you .
&quot; No , because i &apos;ve never seen any evidence saying otherwise ( and psychics and ghosts don &apos;t exist no matter how many people claim they do ) . &quot; Claims of supernatural powers : Confirmed by experiment : 0 % Refuted by experiment : 100 %
lulz , for a second i thought you were serious though.yes , most psychics have been proven to be fakes , but many haven &apos;t. are they real ? i would say that 99 % of the psychics out there are bullshit artists. the other 1 % ... i have no comment . I do know one personally who has scared me sometimes with her predictions though ( and she &apos;s just a little old lady living in a trailer home ) . ghosts , idk. probably not. if so , i truly believe there is a science behind it , and not the spirits stuff. but who knows , maybe one day we &apos;ll figure that one out .
you DO know your tagged as yes don &apos;t you ? ( ;
my point was that it &apos;s impossible to answer , but most people you ask will say yes , so the answer so far is yes .
oh I wasnt responding to your post
The evidence suggests that God does not exist in the sense that my dog exists but that he does exist in the sense that my love for my dog exists.Love is real . God is real
I live in south korea so I &apos;m not really good at English . If there are some wrong Grammers or words , just turn to a blind eye , please .... My opinion is this . God really exist.I &apos;ve never seen him before , but I can assure that God exist.When Most scientists are faced on problem which is beyond of his or her ability , they usually rely on the BIBLE. because BIBLE tells eveything . Have you ever found something wrong in the BIBLE ? May be you haven &apos;t. because it &apos;s real. real God and Jesus story .
There &apos;s some major tooth-fairing on this side. pisses me off since i &apos;m an intermediate in the FIRST place .
Well said , Da Wolfman you got it all there.I also come to believe that we have our own reason why we are living on this earth and that God really exist . I believe in his Salvation , His love , and I have a strong faith in Him . As a blind man , who strongly believes that color blue really exist I have strong belief of Him .
hi i really appreciate your view , i m a hindu and like u say the christ calls u i do experience some things which we do not notice and when we realize we tend to fall suspicious or name it as coincidence or something likethat.but hey there has to be something superior which created life and he calls to understand him.we completely lost in ignorance and worldly belongings like parents , money , wife and children get worse to understand this creator free himself from all bondages and lying very within us
Of course there is God , who made u Science . How does the world spin ? ? ? hah GOD
This discussion in about a belief in God . Yes , science is about observation , pulling together a consensus on what can be observed , experiments that can be replicated , and peer review . God doesn &apos;t fit into this neat little , man defined box , called the scientific method . So , the whole idea of using science as a method to answer the question of whether God exists is silly . God has a plan for everyone , but it is up to each individual to have enough faith to believe it . Using science as a justification to not believe in God is folly , but those who don &apos;t have enough faith to believe won &apos;t realize it until it is too late for them . I wouldn &apos;t call it wishful thinking . The beauty and massive complexity of God &apos;s creation is enough for me to realize that none of this world or universe could exist by accident .
why are people so skeptic , just because there isnt much evidence , doesnt mean that God doesnt exist ! Im only a teenager , but i believe that there has to be something out there watching over us all , otherwise nothing really makes u cant sense.We have to have faith ... I agree , what happens when you die ? it &apos;s hardly like a tv going blank . Your soul cant just die .
The evidence of God &apos;s existence is all around us : You , Me , Life the World , the Universe . There is no way science can explain how something can just come into existence out of nothing . The Big Bang Theory ? Where did that little ball of matter that exploded come from ? How did it come to be ? There is no way to explain the existence of everything in the universe without God or some sort of higher power . In science , one has to know how to explain something , but we don &apos;t have to understand God . One must just have faith . The existence of God is what makes sense to show where everything came from , while science does not makes sense in this subject . Do you really want to believe that your mind , body , spirit , and whole being is just a random collection of matter , that you mean nothing . I don &apos;t know about you , but that is such a grim thought to me .
I only joined to say this.I think God exists since it was beaten into my brain as a kid and now i believe it to be true now that I &apos;m an adult
Of corse God is real . My eveidence to backup my saying is that if you are a christian and you pray , mrical will suddenly happen . Its just unoticable
we may never be able to prove it , as it is down to faith , but yes , i do believe in god
God is my lord in savior and I love him dearly he &apos;s my father in heaven and in the sky . I woudn &apos;t know what to do with my life , I would prabably go to hell when I die .
Why ? I don &apos;t get how it &apos;s confusing ?
Here we have 2 option to believe or not to believe and both can &apos;t be proven to 100 % . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ In case 1 : God Don &apos;t Exist ... You can ask then who created god ... u ask for evidences some even ask for photographs ... but that doesn &apos;t prove god dont exist ... science say that world came to existence thru bigbang and life through evolution ( disputed theory ) . but for the bigbang the first mass was neccessary and for evolution the first environment that initiated it . For a big bang also a first initiation was required ... as science say nothing starts without something starting it or nor do it stop until some one stops it . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Case 2 : God Exist : Claims that nothing can be created by its own , and rather than believing that things was came to existence by its own its logical to believe god exist ... Because if a friend visited my home and see my new computer and ask me &quot; Wow , where did u get that ? &quot; and if u i answer him ... &quot; oh that , ya i had some waste metals , plastic , silcon board etc in my garage and it gradually in years evolved into a PC that works &quot; what will be the response ? BULLSHIT right ? ! ! Its greater bullshit say that man with complex anatomy and high grade intelligence came into existence by chance and probability . Its just and escape from the real scene .... &quot; Let us give chance the unbelievable number of attempts of eight trillion tries per second in each set ! At this speed on average it would take l0 raise-to 147 years to obtain just one stable gene . &quot; u call this science ? ? ! So when both the side are in shadows it logical to go by that make a little sense . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ And many of the Holy Books prediction has come true ! ! !
Your grammar is a little off
The power that religions call God was recognized as the power of creation . How is everything created ? Energy . The energy that surrounds us , and binds us , and makes up everything that exists . So in a manner of speaking , EVERYTHING is God and God is everything .
I find it interesting that today quantum physicist are searching for the first cause , the god particle , and dark matter.God revealed to Moses thousands of years ago , &quot; I am who am &quot; In effect I am what is , the ultimate cause , and it is by faith that we understand this , and faith alone . We will never figure out the ultimate cause until it is revealed to us in heaven.God has chosen us and the only question that remains is , Will we choose him ? Sadly most won &apos;t !
The Big Bang Theory is as much a &quot; lazy excuse for how everything was made &quot; as you say God is . Scientists can only theorize on how the universe was created . Their theories are no more credible than the age-old explanation of creation , and God.Many people reject the concept of Christian faith ; however , one MUST have faith even to believe the scientific theories of the big bang , and evolution .
Man this was awhile ago.Well I would call it faith , I have been raised with an open bible in front of me . Why should I believe otherwise ? I like the whole idea of it also . Sounds great to me and hundreds of millions of others . Why do so many believe it ? Since they either A so it as a way to lose themselves of their problems B sounded good C beaten into the brains of children till they believed it or D AOFB . To me everything sounds good I do not have doubts I like to believe my grandma is watching over me every day may she rest in peace .
Their were hundreds of people that saw Jesus Christ , the question sure as hell isnt did he exist it would be &apos; were his words true ? &apos;
What historians ? When was this ?
I wasn &apos;t trying to back anything up ... I was like the 4th person on this debate I just got moved down ... All I tried to say was that in the bible that was what was said . Not trying to use the bible to back itself up
um lool did you proof read ... ? to start off with how did we know that atilla the hun existed ... or the first Pope , or King Louis the VI ... they didnt have cameras back then lool ... In the Bible it was said that Jesus Christ walked down Rome with a cross on his back and more that 95 % of sales made from the bible are donations
i firmly accept with this statement.we always even in our day to day life we pray god only for goodness and even we believe that if we pray it is for greater good.as you have stated it is not matter of religions .
I &apos;ve tried to make the point that without a real God there can be no good because of the grounding question . Apparently some people aren &apos;t familiar with this question . So I &apos;ve included a link that explains it and demonstrates why there can be no good if there is not a real God . And please don &apos;t commit the genetic fallacy of dismissing the argument because it comes from a Christian source . If you disagree please do so on the merits of the argument , not the source .
I firmly believe that for MOST people in the world it is best that God exists . Purely because the consequences of crossing God are much worse than the laws . You can escape from the law , you can challenge the law , you can appeal against the law . The law is not perfect . The law has it &apos;s flaws . GOD IS PERFECT ( in the believer &apos;s mind ) . You cannot disagree with God as he is MUCH smarter , wiser etc. he is not corrupted and gives what the person deserves . What &apos;s better / worse is that He takes everything the person has done at the end of their life - all the Karma added up at the end of life . So not just one bad incident , but fairly judges him / her after all of their actions.I will contribute more later .
It &apos;s not God who orders that though is it ? You &apos;re bringing in the acts of certain people who have USED religion to perform certain acts . Not only have I said that we should be keeping religions out of this , but also that you cannot blame religion for how people have used it . Several wars were not caused by religion but I don &apos;t see you arguing against athieism for that ...
What about when that god &apos;s followers determine that anyone who doesn &apos;t believe in their perfect , smart , wise , fair god is a dangerous heretic who should be put to death immediately and in a horrific way ? You put to much emphasis on man . Man will always make mistakes Christian or not . Our model on how to be a Christian is how Christ walked the earth . He was peaceful never forced anything upon anybody never put anyone to death for not believing in him . Anything other than this is an abomination on God , one of the ten commandments though shall not kill . I have never known of any Christian who is a firm believing to ask for anybody to be put to death .
And FYI , the original text of the Sixth Commandment read &quot; thou shalt not kill other Israelites . &quot; You could kill all the Canaanites , Babylonians , Akkadians et. al. that you liked.That is pure Grade AAA bull crap . For there was a period of the Israelite history wherein they were Babylonians . And no , the original text of the sixth commandment was originally translated into English as : thou shalt do no murder . The commandment did not imply exceptions for the commandment . If you were to read the next chapter of Exodus that follows the Covenant with Israel , you will find that murderers are to be killed , including Israelites . What say you ?
Nicepost.One thing though .. don &apos;t take the debate description as my main point . I didn &apos;t want to put too much there as it would &apos;ve all pointed towards my side of the argument rather than just give a brief intro to what we should be talking about.So let &apos;s go into your talk about how law work just fine . Laws are changing all the time right ? Now if they were good , then they wouldn &apos;t need to be changed . And if they have been changed then whose to say that they do not need to be changed again ? God &apos;s Words will always be right till the end of time . We just don &apos;t see it , but in the end we will see it . So we can be here right now running around trying to make it all right , or we can follow Gods advice and we &apos;ll get there in the end . It &apos;s hard and loooooong to explain but ask me what God says that is wrong ( one of those rules thats in all religions ) and then tell me that if what he says isn &apos;t wrong ... why should we not follow him .
God &apos;s Words will always be right till the end of time . We just don &apos;t see it , but in the end we will see it . So we can be here right now running around trying to make it all right , or we can follow Gods advice and we &apos;ll get there in the end.lol , alright , that &apos;s really funny . 1 . If what the religious think god wants is always changing , and so are always changing how they act ( don &apos;t eat pork , okay eat pork , have hookers , okay now be celibate , stone people to death , okay turn the other cheek ) lol , then how is that any different than how laws change Kinda ? It &apos;s no different I &apos;m very afraid.I mean , you say his word never changes , we just don &apos;t always get it . But you do see that there is no way for you to know that don &apos;t you ? Whatever , it &apos;s really lame . If no one knows what god is really saying , then it &apos;s just as likely he doesn &apos;t exist.Jeez , I hate debating the religious.The fact is , even if that god does exist , it &apos;s a ridiculous way to run things . I &apos;ll stick to laws , they &apos;re based on living people we see and who feel , live , and die , not some dude no one has ever seen and random people ( who are usually schizos or con-artists ) say said to do this or that.2. And listen , I have read the silly bible probably a dozen times growing up , I was raised Ultra super religious , church 6 days a week , I took 18 credits in religious studies at a very good University , I dated a Baptist preachers daughter all through high school and not only had to sit through the lame sermons , but had to discuss the meanings for hours and hours and hours.There &apos;s nothing about the Christian religion I care to learn , that I probably don &apos;t already know , unless it &apos;s from a historical or anthropological point of view . And if it &apos;s from one of those points of view , I probably already know it .
this would be far more helpful if you said what exactly you were refering to in your responses , butI was using Christianity as an example of a religion in response to you mentioning how laws are always chaning.You brought religion into it when you used how laws change as an example of how it would be better to have the &quot; word of god &quot; because it does not change.And this is the second time in this debate that you first brought up religion , then when a response was made to your introduction to it , you say &quot; this isn &apos;t about religion , this is about god . &quot; At any rate . This is just dumb , because the only people espousing the existance of a god are of one religion or another , and there is no religion that does not change , just as laws change , so my point is incredibly valid , regardless of which religion &apos;s version of the &quot; word of god &quot; I use as an example.At the end of the day , it &apos;s just people.And yeah , I think people who think they hear the word of god are usually schizos of con-artists , because he &apos;s not real , therefore they &apos;re hearing voices or just making stuff up .
I &apos;m sorry this is getting retarded but when did I bring up a particular religion or religion at all ( apart from the fact that religion = following God ) . You &apos;re the one whining about Christianity and all the evil it &apos;s done to you etc. etc . Do you have any knowledge of other religions ? Or other religious ideals outside of Abrahmic faiths ? Who are you to say whether or not God is real ? Nobody can answer that question because nobody knows. you THINK you know , but you don &apos;t in the same way i THINK God exists . You can &apos;t prove or disprove God .
You &apos;re right . Some of the time . Demagoguery is use for ones own benefit . However do you agree that if it was for the benefit of mankind then it is for the greater good ? Forget history , religious sects etc . If demagoguery DID benefit mankind , then it would be for the greater good ? Your argument is that it is used for the benefit of the demagogue . Fairplay , this can go on forever but again you &apos;re basing it , not on God , but on people . If people did it for mankinds good .... then you would say its for the greater good , but if people did it for mankinds bad , then its not for the greater good . Amirite ? ...
I think , even if God doesnt exist , which im not saying he does ... I believe 100 % He does , but even if he didn &apos;t the mere thought of his existance has made many people morally better , and just happier and nicer .
Yes , there can be no good without God . With out an author , everything then becomes a matter of personal preference and interpretation . There is no objective standard by which to judge things . You can &apos;t ask the maker of the product how it should be used . It means man has no purpose for which he was made and therefore there can be no deviation from a norm . But worse than that is if there is no life after death , then justice becomes a sham . Those who go on shooting sprees and then take their lives escape justice . Hitler escaped justice and got off . But the worst thing is that our lives become pointless and without meaning or value . If we come from nothing and return to nothing , folks we are nothing . Our lives have no value . Then there is no difference between gassing termites and gassing 6 million Jews . That ought to scare any sane person . Because then you become a commodity for the state to use and consume for it &apos;s purposes . There is a correlation between Communism and atheism . For further proof pick up a copy of The Guinness Book of World Records and check out the greatest mass murderers of all time : Atheistic regimes , Stalin , Mao etc etc . There is a reason Russia is experiencing a surge in religion . This question is not a theoretical one for them ; they know the answer from first hand experience.I do however think the greater question is why do we have to protect ourselves from ourselves . Take the Ten Commandments , it ought to stagger us that God has to tell us not to murder and steal . Wow ! ! that ought to be a given . We shouldn &apos;t have to be told not to do those things . And then to be threatened with punishment knowing we will do those things . Something is amiss at the very core of who we are . Laws can &apos;t help us because as soon as they get in the way of what we want , they get broke . And it &apos;s painfully obvious religion can &apos;t help either ; it just becomes a facade we hide behind to justify our actions . Others simply turn to atheism , they close their eyes , cross their fingers and hope no one is home in the universe and proceed to do what they want , when they want . Others still will try to plead ignorance : &quot; I really want to do this and If there is a God I &apos;ll just tell Him that I didn &apos;t know that it was wrong &quot; Folks , we need to be saved from ourselves , we are the problem . And when you are lost in the forest the worst thing you can do is ask yourself for directions .
Objection number 1 : Didn &apos;t say you couldn &apos;t be good only that you can &apos;t account for it , it &apos;s the grounding question . You can &apos;t account for good or evil in a purely naturalistic world . Those are moral judgments and making moral judgments is not a characteristic of matter . Hence the saying. dumb as a box of rocksObjection 2 : When you make something it &apos;s usually for a purpose you have in mind , even if it &apos;s just to amuse yourself , there is a reason why you do it . If Intelligent Design is correct it would be wise to find out for what purpose we were createdObjection 3 : Explain to me then how justice is established ? For the record ; Atheistic regimes have slaughtered upwards of 100 million people . All other atrocities combined don &apos;t even come close . But don &apos;t take my word for it. check the records . Ideas have consequences and Darwin &apos;s produced the bloodiest century in human history . And Darwin &apos;s theory was atheistic to the core.Objection 4 : Again , you most certainly can , but you can &apos;t ground it.Objection 5 : See the answer to objection 3 and go look up the greatest mass murderers in the Guinness Book of World Records.Objection 6 : The evidence doesn &apos;t support your assertion . Objection 7 : I was driving at the point that we even violate each other. that we do it at all is the greater problem . But again you can &apos;t account for Good or evil , Those are moral judgments and making moral judgments is not a characteristic of matter . Objection 8If there is a God , then we have hope . Because when you have been caught in the rip tide and you &apos;re drowning , you don &apos;t save yourself . And unless someone jumps into rescue you , you are as good as dead . In atheism , there is no lifeguard and no one on shore , you are all alone . In Christianity the lifeguard is on duty and He is able to save and He does . How differently will you live your life once you have been taken out of the mouth of death as it swallowed you ? In what do you have hope ? and not the wishful thinking kind , that does no one any good . The confident certain kind that you can stand on.About crossing fingers . Take the time to read Pascal &apos;s Wager . I think the way I characterized atheism is pretty accurate . The smart money is on Jesus.Objection 9 : You presuppose the descent of Man and then use that paradigm to interpret the facts . Might I suggest there might be another way to account for religion . The trouble with your explanation is that it is far to simple and fails to account for a great deal of factors ; such as the reality that men don &apos;t event things far for terrible than what they know . The idea is always to appease the gods , aka forces of nature , you don &apos;t make something up vastly superior to the natural world.And again you mis-characterize history .
You really should do your research before making comments like these because you lose credibility with those who have.Take all the religious killings and they still don &apos;t come close to those done by atheistic ideology ( communism ) What these Communistic regimes did was the logical out working of the atheismism they held to . It should be painfully obvious that atheism is a flawed worldview .
Not just communists ... all regimes including capitalism ( which imo has caused the most ) have caused billions of deaths , directly or indirectly.Lord of War anybody ? ... That &apos;s definately not religion in play.Blood Diamond ? Just examples of how capitalism holds people down to benefit themselves .
See the problem here is we &apos;re going in circles . I &apos;ve already said inherintly people are good in general and naturally know what is wrong and right and religion tends to go side by side with that . I &apos;m not saying it &apos;s because of religion , but that they &apos;re intwined . I &apos;ve also said ( maybe not on this debate ) that it &apos;s wrong when people do things without questioning - however it doesn &apos;t mean you always and continously question everything.You cannot use scientific method unless you already have a moral view . Science gives us some of the harms of using drugs , however it is upto us whether or not that is good or bad . Science says that drugs do blah blah to your body and mind . It gives statistics linking drug abuse to crime . It is people that say it &apos;s wrong . Science cannot say whether it is good or not for society to have crime etc . It can say that drug abuse affects the country in this or that way ... but it cannot say it is wrong.I &apos;ve stated that we &apos;ll never understand the full extent of our actions and even if we understand some of them .. is it truly right ? Science itself is continously debating itself . Before you could hit your kids , then we &apos;re taught not to ... and now there &apos;s growing debate that you should hit your kids ( not abuse .. hit ) . This is science . We always think we know what we &apos;re doing and we know the results of our actions , however we don &apos;t and there &apos;s no way of telling . Look at the core of all the religions and tell me whether or not they are harmful to you or others around you.Even worse is the fact that again you &apos;re this example of this pastor as something against religion . Where in the Bible does it say go kill the abortionist ? Would the majority of people condemn his actions ? Was it truly in the name of God or was it through frustration and anger ? People who do these things - Drug dealers , murderers , ( maybe homos ) , gangsters etc . They ALL know what they &apos;re doing is wrong . All of them . ( Unless they &apos;ve got a mental issue ) . That pastor knows what he &apos;s done is wrong ... but will defend himself nontheless . He will say that killing the doctor is a step towards stopping abortions , however he knows that killing a man is wrong . All of these people know what they do is wrong , but do it anyway and most of them say they &apos;re religious but do not follow the religion . When I drink alcohol , I know it &apos;s not right . It doesn &apos;t bother me ... but I know that I don &apos;t need to , have to etc ... but I do .. for my own selfish reasons . It &apos;s not something that bugs me .. it &apos;s just something small that I know I shouldn &apos;t do . Same as people who smoke ... they know they shouldn &apos;t smoke , but they do . Atheists smoke ... technically according to you , they shouldn &apos;t because they know the harm it does to them and because they use scientific reasoning objectively , they wouldn &apos;t smoke . They do . Same as theists.It &apos;s hard for me to explain other religious communities accurately because I haven &apos;t lived in them .. but my own . Relgion IS subjective and you keep missing that . The priests teach / lecture / explain the philosophy of the religion , that is their purpose.I really wonder how God is speaking to all these people directly in ways that contradict each other.That &apos;s an argument for which religion is right .
Lol .. low level debate . Thanks luv , now I know it is actually good.Ideally we should refrain from emitting moral judgments when we don &apos;t have enough informationSo how much is enough information ? ? Do we actually know enough about anything to make the right choice ? ? You can only make a 100 % correct judgement once you know EVERYTHING .. not just about one thing , but everything about everything ... i.e. omnipotence . Because with that knowledge you would know the reaction to your action 100 % .When religious people seek answers in prayer , the answer has a high chance of just being a subjective personal intuition . If religious people would really look for answers they would have to start by first questioning the very existence of god , and requiring proof.Ofcourse it MIGHT be subjective personal intuition . Someone would only every give their opinion . If somebody came and asked you about God , don &apos;t tell me you &apos;d say He exists ... or give strong points to His existance . In the same way youve got as much subjective personal intuition .. even though I know you like to think you don &apos;t . Religious people tend to be religious after having looked at answers or accepting answers . Nobody is religious without thinking about it atleast once in their lifetime.Slavery - You &apos;re telling me it &apos;s wrong ? The economical benefits they provide .. manual labour .. make lives easier for their owners etc . I &apos;m not one to agree with it .. but you con &apos;t tell me there &apos;s no positives to slavery.I do not agree with it , not because of some &quot; personal ideology &quot; but because I believe all human beings to be equalContradiction . Believing all human beings are equal is an ideology.In your example of a country that bans homosexuality , I would also find that rather disgusting - how can it be right to judge a person by what he / she does in bed ? are they harmful to society ? how ? It &apos;s disgusting to you ? ? Homosexuality itself is disgusting to me . Not because of God or what my parents say . Again when it comes to gayness .. my reasoning will seem absurd and easily arguable .. but I think I &apos;m right when it comes to it . But YOU reasoning that people should be able to do whatever they want to aslong as they think it doesn &apos;t affect anybody is selfishness to the maximum.I &apos;m a bigot huh ? you &apos;re obviously completely tolerant of religious people . It &apos;s a shame .. I thought you were intelligent at the start .
Without question God is in favor of men who love him . Christians give more money to charities to than all others combined . Greater is He who is in me than he who is in the world . John 4 4 : Our founding fathers built this nation based on God , whether people want to accept it or not it &apos;s all over the and written into the constitution for people that don &apos;t agree with the doctrine than move to another country where there Constitution fits your beliefs more . It &apos;s not just by coincidence that we have become the most powerful nation on every level in the shortest amount of time in history . However the further we as a nation get further away from God the more kaos and trouble we will face as a nation , and that is happening now .
I respect your opinion that &apos;s just the way you feel . I hardly ever see or hear about agnostics giving anything to any charity . It &apos;s a given fact the Christians and Organizations help more than any other . If tomorrow God came down and took all the the believers away and there was no more Christians this world would go to hell in a hand basket fast . I guess the argument is for the greater good . For years we have asked God to get out of our schools and our life and our country . So when something bad happens like 9 / 11 we all of a sudden ask God why did he remove his protection . Total Hypocrisy
I &apos;m sorry you have so much disbelief . Obviously you put a lot of energy to justify in your own-self about any faith towards God . I &apos;m just going dispute some of the comments about if the world would be better of if Christians where gone . All I have to say is think of a places in the world where there is no God and you will only see death , poverty and despair . The evolution is a farce . Do you remember the cover of national geographic when they had a ape like skull saying that they have found the missing link . Of course that was found out to be a fraud . Point I &apos;m making is , all you have to do is look around and look at the perfect order of nature the extreme complexity and to not even think that there is a creator designer behind it that it is just a mere coincidence . It &apos;s just stupid to think that all you are is just a piece of walking flesh do to the fact that evolution is the only reason you are here . And that all of nature with it &apos;s perfect order is because . Just look up the number of charities and the number is overwhelmingly Christian based probably the number would be actually more because a lot of them are but are afraid of persecution from Church and State laws.You have denial issues I think deep down you really feel that all of these things are possible but you have chosen to block it out and harden yourself for the truth.You know what makes me laugh is that you have Agnostic historians looking in the bible for references to help them find ancient cities and places . Take Troy for example just to name one out the dozens . They thought it was a myth until they discovered it referenced passages out of the bible to help them . Dude totally have taken the whole 9 / 11 thing to far . Pretty insulting of course I don &apos;t believe those you said . All I was saying is that we have been relatively safe as a nation and my faith believes that yes God does protect us nothing wrong with that . Bad things do happen no matter what trials and tribulations are a part of life.As far as using you storied and other quotes from people and Tibet tribes whatever . I don &apos;t care what they think . I don &apos;t look to others to convince me of what I know and believe I question man when I hear a preacher or someone else taking about their Ideas . All I know is that there is a God and creator of us and everything . It &apos;s my own personal believe . Shame on those missionaries for using a lame story about that which is not true . If they where Mormon that would sound like a BS story from them .
Actually it &apos;s not funny . The case in Florida where school kids where raising money for a benefit and there where teachers present . What makes it worse is that it was in a church off school property and spontaneously someone said lets say a prayer to bless this food . Well do you know what happened board member who was there at the church but obviously not a Christian was offended and reported those teachers and they where looking at fines in the thousands plus 6 months in jail . It went to the Florida St supreme court where the judge smartly ruled against the claim and they where found not to be in violation . This is just one case of many . I &apos;m sure that there are other religions that pray but why only are the Christians the ones that are being persecuted ? Agnostic it &apos;s biased the whole system is Agnostic we abide by Agnostic rules in everyday life especially in schools , essentially we practice your religion where there is no belief and when there &apos;s a crazy wig nut Agnostic that wants to throw teachers in jail for six months because of their inherent freedoms you go crazy.Evolution has not been proved it &apos;s a theory nowhere except for a completely biased person would say that evolution has been proved . There is a whole debate on that alone . There are numerous scientist that believe in intelligent design and go as far as Micro evolution which I believe in and is in-line with creation . Macro evolution where a Giraffe one day came from the see is as unlikely as you or I beating Tiger Woods in a golf match . Not going to happen . God says that we are created in is own image which is why our minds are godlike . If evolution is true than there would be more species with our capability to think and to rationalize . This fact alone baffles many evolutionary theorist for they don &apos;t have an answer for . So they do what Darwin did just make stuff up and throw clay at a human skull to fill the gaps .
You take things really extreme . I &apos;m one of those that is not trying to force schools to pray not at all . I just get upset when it &apos;s completely away from it and someone tells . It reminds me of the movie 1984 . As far as the Texas thing I familiar with that being a part of the bible belt no one objected it was only one person who complained and affected the rights of hundreds that preferred to pray . Overwhelmingly the community was upset what happened to democracy even in religion where the wants and needs of the many out ways the needs of the few . Right now it &apos;s going the other way where the few are outweighing the many I guess that &apos;s what makes great news . Media loves feuds .
I think you got confused when I said when it &apos;s completely away from it and someone tells , I was referring to the school teachers attending a function at the church it was completely away from school and on their own time .
Stop down voting me i like having a debate but if everytime I leave a comment you down vote I &apos;m just going to stop. i have stopped down voting you . It &apos;s almost an unfair format in here being one of the few and only conservative Christians in this entire CreateDebate it &apos;s like being fed to the Lions . That &apos;s why any conservative in here gets jumped all over , there &apos;s nothing to argue agianst when all of you our on the same belief . You guys need someone like me to make it interesting .
are we forget ? who is the Creator us in the world ? is it a human ? is it a president ? or is it a priest ? we are burned in to the world because of god hand , , the god have been giving us mercy and blessing so we can enjoy in this world with many complete body , , every day , , every time , , the god was giving us existence so we can take a walk with our girlfriend or our boyfriend go to the mall , , hangout , , eating , , swimming , , joking , , and other event , , ARE YOU DO NOT REALIZE ? the god was giving us two hand so we can use it for doing something such as eating , , foot ball , , play a game , , giving thing to pauper and other good action , , ARE YOU STILL DO NOT REALIZE ?
Why not give the judgment of charity and not condemnation . Wouldn &apos;t you expect that if you were visiting a foreign country ?
What does it take to decide what is the greater good . You need a moral agent using logic and reason to asses a current situation and then to judge that against a perceived standard . The only thing in that string of events that is physical and made up of matter is the moral agent , but it &apos;s morality , logic , reason , assessment and judgment are not . To put it another way ; you can &apos;t open it &apos;s head and see it &apos;s thoughts . They have no projection in space ; a characteristic of matter . And don &apos;t tell me it &apos;s like computer memory because every one knows what happens to your hard-drive when you put to much on it . The last time I checked , no ones head gets bigger the more they know ( well I guess it does in one way ) The point is that these are non-physical realities . And no they &apos;re not the product of chemical reactions , you can mix water and baking soda all day and the bubbles will never talk to you.Point is this ; If atheism is true than we have a whole lot of stuff that shouldn &apos;t be here . A lot of non-physical realities in a purely physical world . A lot of stuff that atheism can &apos;t account for . Well , they can if they use those non-physical realities to prove that those non-physical don &apos;t exist . Oh whoops , darn it that &apos;s a self refuting argument .
If you down voted this argument it would be more credible if you gave a reason why .
That &apos;s sounds nice ; but why should I ? It &apos;s a whole lot easier to live for myself . Besides who cares if things get better or not ? If there is no God what difference does it make ; everything just becomes an exercise in futility . We have no purpose or meaning apart from God . Without God what then is the moral imperative ? What then is the &quot; ought &quot; to . Why should we care ? Without God we are all headed for nothing . You should take some time to walk through a cemetery and if you get a chance to see a fresh dug grave , stare at it for a while because that my friend is your destiny .
The real question to ask about any proposed god - Allah , The Christian God , Thor , Zeus or whoever is &quot; What evidence is there for the existence of this being ? &quot; This is exactly the same question that one could ask about unicorns , fairies , Steve Jobs or Paris Hilton.In the case of the last two the is testable empirical evidence which can be pointed to . In the case of Zeus and the unicorn this evidence is lacking . We are quite happy to accept that such lack of evidence is sufficient for us to dismiss the existence of Thor and fairies . Logically we should take the same lack of positive evidence to dismiss the existence of Allah and the Christian God as well .
This is just plain silly . Are you saying only through education can people be right ? There are millions of people out there who are uneducated and I would say they are more likely to go to heaven than I am . Education has f * ck all to do with this.I &apos;ve said from the start not to bring different cases of religion in this . This is purely an argument about God , regardless of what religion is brought in . Not religion , not religious texts , scriptures , rules etc . I could go into greater detail and dismantle your argument but we &apos;ll be going into something completely different .
Your an athiest for other reasons than that don &apos;t kid yourself .
You know what ? They are right , we are no different than animals , there is no God I &apos;m happy and content knowing that now my life is easier because of it and when I die that will be all , that &apos;s a pretty happy ending to a great life , shitty or not .
Remember the old testament in the Bible uses the word Elohim in ancient hebrew . In fact Psalms 82 : 1,6 talk about &quot; gods . &quot; But if we talk about the Cause of the Creation of the Universe , yes God the Father is He .
Hopefully you &apos;re not being serious in the first paragraph . In general human kind is decent . You &apos;re making it seem that the world can live without authority . My point is that we need some form of authority and that God is the ultimate authority.Again people are decent and do things out of their own hearts , but the world doesn &apos;t work in that way , the majority of people need to be pushed in the right direction , no matter how big or small that push is.I am not trying to portray God as a terrible guy with a whip which keeps as in line . Only showing His superiority to the police or law.Who is God ? The Almighty , Benevolent , Omniscient etc . He is the most moral , righteous , loving , wise etc . He is perfection . That is God . God tells people to do out of love , nobility , righteousness etc . But he has also set the law . Because He is God , His law is right , so living by His word is right . We cannot decide what is right or wrong , as we all have different opinions of what is wrong or right . So if you are to say tread the noble path ... wtf is the noble path ? It &apos;s easy to say , but your noble path is completely different to my noble path and if everybodies noble path is different then there is only one being who can truly decide what is right and wrong as He is Right . THAT is God . He loves you , He takes care of you , He guides you , He juedges you , He punishes and rewards you . In the end He can do everything that nobody else can do.You understand where I &apos;m coming from ?
Lol . No I think you &apos;re sick in the head . If you think the world works without police , army , governments , courts , laws , teachers , doctors etc. then you need to be locked up.Let me repeat - GOD IS NOT JUST THE ULTIMATE &apos; PUNISHMENT &apos; . HE IS ALL . HE LOVES YOU THE MOST , HE GUIDES YOU THE BEST , HE DOES EVERYTHING BETTER THAN ANYBODY IN REAL LIFE CAN . THAT IS WHY HE IS GOD . If you have an IQ above 50 you would understand what I &apos;m saying . So far you haven &apos;t.Please explain to me what the definition of God is ? Then tell me whether or not that definition means He is better than any human alive . It does right ? ... hmmmm ..... So doesn &apos;t that mean by following somebody who knows all is the right way in life ? ... I don &apos;t know about you , but to me I would follow somebody who knew everything and would do the best for me rather than to follow somebody who knew quite a bit and would do the best for me . ANYday.Ofcourse People need other people to guide them . THAT IS WHY GOD SENDS DOWN PROPHETS . They are there to tell people God &apos;s word .
We &apos;re just going round in circles . Firslty , I don &apos;t believe in Christianity . However as I &apos;ve said SEVERAL times that people ARE good in GENERAL . So if YOU think that I think that we NEED GOD to be w / e .. then again you have completely missed what I &apos;ve said . Not just once , or twice , but now 3 times . ( That &apos;s quite a lot of times ehh ) People ARE good . But explain to me what being good is ? Is murder good ? In certain circumstances is it justified ? Or is it never justified ? I feed my kids because I love my kids , not because God tells me to . Even if he did not tell me to , I would still feed them . It &apos;s the right thing to do.One example . Adultery . You tell me is it right or wrong ? Those who have thought of or have actually cheated will say its right , but those who haven &apos;t will say its wrong . Can we make a decision on whether or not it should be punishable ? In the end , God says its wrong . I think He has a better idea of whether or not its right or wrong . THAT is why we take his word , because we cannot make the right decision.Hopefully you understand this time . Fourth time lucky . Yay ........
Do you understand the meaning of greater good ? It &apos;s basically that the end justifies the means . If people were to behave better under a lie ( IF God is a lie ) then wouldn &apos;t it be better to promote that lie ? THAT is the greater good.I &apos;m sorry , but just because you &apos;re right doesn &apos;t mean people will automatically follow you . World doesn &apos;t work like that .
Thank you for this post . I &apos;ve been waiting for something like this . : Dperhaps you can clarify , what the greater good is and how we can identify what it is . Let &apos;s put it like this.A mother taking her kid for a walk . The kid keeps falling over and cries until the mother picks the kid up and lets her continue to walk . The mother and child are both happy and everytime the child falls , the mother picks the child up.A mother taking her kid for a walk . The kid keeps falling over and cries , but the mother does not pick the kid up . Its cold and unloving , but the mother will not help . Everytime the child falls , the mother only watches.The first mother &apos;s child never learns to pick itself up and one day on its own , when it fell , it never got back up . The second child however had learnt how to get back up and on its own was able to continue in life.The second one is the greater good . The mother may seem insensitive and harsh at first , but in the long run , the outcome led to the child &apos;s survival . This may seem like an obvious and maybe even biased example , but that is what I mean by the greater good.explain why on your introduction to the debate you have us imagine that we are creating a religion . Read it . It said look at it from this point of view . I haven &apos;t brought religion , its values , its history or its rules or stories . Just one of God &apos;s roles.What benefit can there be to society where people are creating their own guidelines to follow based on a subjective understanding of a God ? Let me name you 5 prophets . Krishna , Moses , Buddha , Jesus , Muhammed.These people are not creating their own guidelines , but are taking God &apos;s Word . Not their understanding , but word for word , God &apos;s Words . Over time however Jesus &apos;s words have been distorted ( as an example ) which is not God or Jesus &apos;s fault but those who have distorted their word . They are the true prophets . There are several others , but you wouldn &apos;t have heard of them . Elron Hubbard is not a prophet , so his followers DO believe in crap and are NOT a benefit to society . But realistically , all religions all in all follow similar rules and these similar rules have nothing stupid.The systematized rules that you mention , come from religion , NOT a belief in god.Ok good point . Especially with the Agnostic part . However earlier I &apos;ve explained earlier that the systematized rules come from God . But we &apos;re not here to talk about the differences in those rules . Just that God HAS given Rules to us . Let &apos;s not argue about which one is correct .. that is for a different debate . These rules are for us to follow for the good of mankind . How do we know it &apos;s for the good of mankind ? Because God gave it to us . God , who is all knowing , all powerful etc . THAT is why we know it is right and if we followed them , we would be living in paradise.IMO agnostics are just confused . They aren &apos;t sure on what God wants etc . I &apos;ll come to this later . ( Remind me ) ... May I ask you why you believe that people are not able to figure things out on their own ? If people were able to figure things out on their own , we wouldn &apos;t have any rules etc . The reason we have the law is to guide people . The MAJORITY . How many people out there CAN actually run the country , make all the perfect laws etc ? Only God &apos;s word is right , because God is perfect only He can make the correct decision.You say that religion should not take the blame for a lot of the ills in society , but look how far religion has come and yet it doesn &apos;t seem we are learning how to get along . Maybe it is time to let people figure things out , and see what happens instead of getting stuck in the idea that people need some mythical being to tell them what to do.Again it is not religion which is in the wrong . Religion does say not to kill , drink etc. yet that is what you &apos;re saying is wrong . It &apos;s not religion that caused crusades . It was religion that was USED . Most wars etc. aren &apos;t fought for over religion , but merely use religion as an excuse to get people drawn into it.Maybe it is time to let people figure things out , and see what happens instead of getting stuck in the idea that people need some mythical being to tell them what to do.This is my problem . I have seen all around me what has happened due to the lack of religion . You tell me the problems in todays societies and then tell me is that due to the lack of religion or because of religion . Examples ? - Underage sex , alcohol , tobacco , drugs , rape , murder , violence , greed , lust , intoxicants , envy etc . What is it that religion says about those issues ?
1 . These prophets MAY just be intelligent people as you said . But they have ALL claimed to be related to God in some way . If they ARE followers of God , then great . If they &apos;re NOT , then why have they &apos; used &apos; God ? THAT was my original argument .. the reasons for having God . ( I &apos;ve been completely sidetracked ) .2 . The reason I do not want to bring in religion is for the reasons you &apos;ve stated . There are several different religions all doing different things and as soon as we start discussing God &apos;s word as interpretted by these religions , we &apos;ll be arguing about religions and not God.The mother does not explain to the child because the child will not understand , it will just continue to cry and beg . In the same way we do not understand God &apos;s word , but in both circumstances the child and us people will benefit if we follow God &apos;s / mother.we know that we shouldnt kill because it is common senseSomeone rapes a child .. should he be killed ? You go to war , should you kill ? You loose your temper , should you kill ? Someone is trying to kill you , should you kill ? You &apos;ve had enough of life , should you kill yourself ? You &apos;re in a vegetative state , should you be killed ? God will tell us the right answer no matter what . However people have different opinions on those questions and both will argue their side . Who &apos;s right and who &apos;s wrong . Nobody on earth truly knows the impact of the decision they &apos;ve made . This goes to your education point too . You &apos;re telling me all the finest , most educated people on the planet make the choices ? in terms of ethics , religion etc ?
THE fool has said in his heart there is no GOD ... QUOTE from the bible . AS a human with an intelligence only format , I would have to conclude that : I DON &apos;T know ... SO to , would any other unbiased human .... To be able to say one way or the other would set YOURSELF up to have a GOD attribute , that of knowing ALL ... I won &apos;t go there ... I will go to my faith that swears to me that GOD does exist ; as HE has revealed himself to me several ways .... ( 1 ) NATURE &amp; surroundings , ( 2 ) THE revelation of GOD through CHRIST JESUS &amp; HIS Life , Death &amp; ( RESURECTION ) ... RESURRECTION being the key element in human terms .... ( 3 ) The gift of GOD &amp; HIS understanding which I have , &amp; THAT , the faith to believe COMES from somewhere BESIDE myself , for I witnessed a HEART or CORE change within myself , when I accepted HIS terms of SALVATION ... I cannot deny what testimony HE has imparted to me &amp; I cannot deny MY own experience &amp; experiences of others that are similar to mine in this REALM .... ( 4 ) HE has directed my thoughts &amp; actions to be someone , I , in myself am not ... HE has apparently , by deed &amp; actions changed my heart as HE said HE would ... HE &amp; I cannot deny those facts &amp; testiment ... Therefore I Within myself must conclude that GOD does exist per my life story &amp; predestination set in motion by a force beyond MY control .... That force , or SPIRIT , as most refer to ; is indwelt &amp; locked , sealed my fate ... I no longer am my own self ... I have been bought with a price &amp; am sealed to that which I believe , AS told , is : MY ETERNAL LIFE .... CHRIST in ME is ETERNAL LIFE .HE &amp; I shall go on together after this natural death ... HE said it I didn &apos;t ... I believe HIM for it ....
Mass suicides is a completely modern and retarded thing for a VERY minor percentage of the population .. that REALLY shouldn &apos;t be used as an example specially when it &apos;s with the brainwashed ... NO CULTS SHOULD ! ! GRR ! ! The followers of non-abrahimic religions cannot be expected to know everything scientifically just as we don &apos;t know everything scientifically . You &apos;re right , their rituals weren &apos;t &apos; scientifically &apos; correct but not everything we do know is &apos; good &apos; either . This whole global warming fiasco is something we &apos;re all contributing to everyday and don &apos;t you think that &apos;s a whole lot worse than a few &apos; stupid dances &apos; to make it rain ? Why is it that we continue to do all the things damaging the environment even when we KNOW it &apos;s damaging the environment ? We &apos;re much more informed , yet we &apos;re doing bad right ? If we are much better without God and are able to make better decisions why is it that we seem to disagree more and more ? It &apos;s all about mentality . Back then , things were a lot more black and white and todays society has created more and more colours , not just because of more information , butit &apos;s peoples inabilities to make the right decisions . That is because there isn &apos;t really a basis to say whether or not what they want is right or wrong because as you said it &apos;s up to people to make the right choice and less and less people are making the right choices.You talked about how Egyptians could &apos;ve spent their resources better ... We &apos;re constantly wasting resources , not just on pointless research , but on things which will probably be harmful 20years down the line . Cigarettes , Alcohol , Fast Food , Petrol , CFC &apos;s , Waste etc. etc . All societies have their negatives , but I would prefer to dance for rain or bury people in tombs or pray for life than accept sodomy , sell my soul for money , have no respect for myself ...
Even though I &apos;m against abrahimic religions , I still respect them and find it insulting that they &apos;re thought to be as deranged as cults.Obviously you should do the same when choosing your religion . I haven &apos;t really got a problem with athiests except when they think they &apos;re intellectually superior because they &apos;re athiest . They think that only ignorant and stupid people believe in God , and smart person knows that holds no basis , but it &apos;s different to say &apos; there is no God &apos; than saying &apos; I do not believe in God &apos; . Same goes to theists who say &apos; there is God &apos; rather than saying &apos; I believe in God &apos; .Thing about being more educated , it doesn &apos;t mean more common sense , which in that video you showed yourself , people are loosing these days . I would say in general the way people are educated , raised these days , they don &apos;t have much common sense . That I would say is more important than any education in the world.My argument about the extra inter-species breeding , part lion shit is to do with today &apos;s mentality of &apos; if he wants to , then he should &apos; or &apos; if it doesn &apos;t hurt anybody ... &apos; etc . It &apos;s a downward spiral that will only lead further and further from the strict &apos; man and woman have sex for kids &apos; . A bit of leeway is ok . But in todays society ... homosexuals ? transvestites ? transexuals ? zoophilia ? necrophilia ? Where does it stop ? ? There isn &apos;t a limit because we &apos;re loosing morals to &apos; science &apos; or i would say &apos; freedom &apos; . Right now , zoophilia might be looked down upon , but give it a few years and it will be today &apos;s transexuality . Understand that freedom isn &apos;t always a good thing . It comes with it &apos;s negatives.You &apos;re right about that Jesus camp thing . That is brainwashing and I think a lot of Christians themselves would be against it , but it is not God who inhibits the ability to decide for yourselves , but he definately gives the best path and it is for us to decide whether or not to take it , but in the end karma always comes back around . If you have lived a good life ( whether or not you believe in God ) you will be rewarded and if you have lived a bad life ( whether or not you believe in God ) you will be punished.It &apos;s not ignorance if you agree with God or to have faith in God &apos;s word . Take me for example . I know that we would live in a much better world without alcohol , yet I drink it myself . People argue against drinking it . At best people say it should be drunk responsibly . I personally agree with that , yet in my religion you shouldn &apos;t drink any . I &apos;ve had many bad experiences with alcohol .. I &apos;m pretty sure everybody who has drunk it has . Now , would you be better off without alcohol or with it ? I SAY without it , yet ACT with it . It &apos;s not just God said so ... but He is right ? Same with smoking ( except I don &apos;t really smoke ) .
A religion cannot be cultish .. because they &apos;re both different things.The fact that you argued for zoophilia shows that this has gone beyond point . You &apos;re telling me that I can go up to somebody and kill them . He &apos;s dead so I don &apos;t hear him complaining ... so it is ok . Kids should be slitting their own risks . Even even they cause permanant damage , it &apos;s ok because they &apos;re only doing it to themslves . We should take drugs , because we &apos;re doing it ourselves . I &apos;m glad you think that way.By saying alcohol is bad you ARE agreeing with &apos; God &apos;s word &apos; . God says &apos; alcohol is bad &apos; , you say &apos; Yes , it is bad &apos; ... you are agreeing with God . Maybe for different reasons ... but the conclusion is the same.I just want to know now if you are against zoophilia , yes or no . If you are not against it for the reasons that people should be able to do what they want with themselves ... then I really do not want to continue debating .
Everywhere in nature , in flowers , in trees , in leaves , in animals , in mountains , and in women is beauty . Is it just that it has become beauty because we have been around it so long ? or is there a common brush stroke , a style . Like that that can distinguish a Monet from a Rembrandt . There is a common brush stroke , a golden ratio , a golden curve , the fibonacci series that is repeated throughout nature , and is present in all things we preceive as beauty . There is no survival reason for it , no reason for it to have evolved . It is art for the sake of art , and the artist is God . To look around you and not see the hand of the artist is the same as assuming the Mona Lisa was created by accident when a house painter was cleaning his brushes on some canvas . Beauty in nature is what has instilled in man a sense of God even in times and places where there was no religion , or writing , or even language . Go to Yosemite , look around and think which is more outragous , that it is all accident or art created by an artist .
Ahh ok . When it comes to sexual acts .. its a lot harder to argue with because you can &apos;t really explain why it &apos;s bad . Same as homosexuality .. it &apos;s hard to explain why it &apos;s bad . All I know in my heart is that it &apos;s wrong . You &apos;re asking me why ... I don &apos;t know why .. I do know that it &apos;s wrong though .. and it goes hand in hand with this &apos; downward spiral &apos; in todays society . 1 thing though , I don &apos;t do anything because God says so . I agree with Him ... not follow Him blindly.Thing about right and wrong - There is no proof to it . That is one thing I can garauntee you 100 % . It &apos;s purely opinion or one &apos;s own thoughts . Science has no morals . Nor has facts . Morals , right and wrong does not go hand in hand with numbers , statistics and tests . Morality is outside of explanations through science . Sometimes you do things for the sake of doing . You don &apos;t question everything . Some things you can question ... and still do it , some things you question and don &apos;t do it , but questioning everything is just as bad as not questioning everything .
Naaah ... this downward spiral has nothing to do with religion imo . It &apos;s through what I &apos;ve seen , done , heard of etc. that I believe this , whether religion was there or not . I think religion plays a big factor in it , but it &apos;s not a religious thing for me.Science has no morals . Moral is based on judgment , opinion etc . It &apos;s not a religious thing either , but right and wrong is not science . Science is simply an explanation of things.You commit suicideScience says you are dead . Morals say it &apos;s wrong ( or in certain culture it &apos;s right ) .Science can &apos;t judge whether dying is good or bad . It can only state what happens . Morals are judgments.It &apos;s kind of silly to say religious people do not base their morality on evidence .. lol . You hear them all the time arguing , debating continuously using evidence to prove their righteousness . Both sides rely on evidence ... and if you think otherwise , you &apos;re deluding yourself .
I wouldn &apos;t really say it &apos;s monotheism , but definately the religions that are strongly monotheist . However , I do not blame &apos; monotheism &apos; for it , it &apos;s more of the agression these religions ( abrahimic ) have . Your thoughts on eastern religions are interesting and I &apos;m guessing you &apos;re saying they are based on philosophy ?
Well seeing as their cults I wouldn &apos;t really look into them too much . I did some research into them and they do seem completely different to Abrahimic faiths . I would certainly say that Eastern religions are based on philosophy with them being more interested into the understanding of one self in correspondance to the universe . Mythology , history , culture and philosophy I would say are basis of eastern religions also with the founder having lesser significance than abrahimic faiths .
NiceSo you &apos;re saying tranquility and order ( also a good way life ? ) is NOT the greater good ? I don &apos;t agree that it neuters healthy skepticism and religious people have a good measure of doubt . People are always thinking twice about everything they do , that &apos;s normal , difference with theists is they follow their religion . Doesn &apos;t mean they don &apos;t doubt . Problem these days is TOO much doubt and TOO much skepticism .
I think we have different understandings of what a religious society leads to . I don &apos;t blame you but that &apos;s simply because you &apos;re basing your thoughts on history , but moreover history of certain religions as Christianity , Islam and ( not so sure ) Judaism . However what would you say to a Buddhist society ? Or a Hindu society ? Certain religions have been detrimental , but imo other religions , some extinct , some not , did not have the problems you &apos;ve described. egyptians ? Ancient chinese and indian ? ancient greeks etc. etc . They were all deeply religious societies ( correct me if I &apos;m wrong ) which did not have the same borders as you &apos;re describing ( again correct me if I &apos;m wrong ) .
by borders i meant the part where you said at the expense of justice , liberty etc .
This is a great argument , so I marked you up , even though some idiot decided to mark you down ... BUT the problem is that you &apos;re still putting MAN &apos;s mistakes as God &apos;s discredit . You &apos;re right that it is the belief in God that some of these things occur , but then again that can be applied to anything anybody strongly believes in . Take football in England ... and how &apos; hooligans &apos; go about it ... the fights , friendships , groups etc . ( You &apos;ve seen Greenstreet right ? ) People fight , go extreme , argue etc. over DIFFERENCES , PERCEPTIONS , INTOLERANCE , IGNORANCE etc.The thing about having no God and having people think for themselves is that each and everysingly person &apos;s mentality and moral coding will be different to their neighbour &apos;s and imo that will bring about more destruction than having a God even in today &apos;s world.My point is that having God , without abusing &apos; Him &apos; , would create a better mentality for people than those who do not follow God .
hmmm ......... People will have differences , but what about religions that not only accept other people &apos;s beliefs or lack of them ? I do not think it &apos;s right to accept people for what they are ... or SOME people anyway . When it comes to race , nationality , eye colour , hair colour , religions ( not cults ) etc. people should and do live side by side . Some issues are contreversal i.e. sexuality , cross-gender , physical enhancements etc. which I think should be eliminated.I ain &apos;t not hitler dude , lol . I don &apos;t have a problem with differences and in touch with points made earlier the religions I am in favour of have always been very tolerant to certain issues , so wouldn &apos;t it be better for not just an extremely tolerant religion , but broad , flexible and continuously evolving religion ?
: D You are looking at the POV of abrahimic religions . My example is Hinduism , Buddhism , Taosim and probably a lot more that have allowed freedom to worship whatever religion they please .
Isn &apos;t it amazing that Mankind still debates the existence of God ? Man isn &apos;t sure that he believes in God , ... yet all the while God still believes in Man , and extends His hand in creation of the foundation for reconciliation and the offer is still open while Man breathes.Hebrews 11 : 1 offers us confidence that even as God believes in His own existence and the existence of Man , Man has the opportunity to believe in God with confidence.The LORD has apparently never seen the NEED to prove his existence because He doesn &apos;t need it ! He KNOWS He exists ! On the other hand , Man HAS apparently often questioned his own existence , ergo a statement of belief in Man &apos;s own existence was necessary to be codified , &quot; I think ! Therefore , I am ! &quot; If Man who is often agnostic about his own existence can &apos;t use the Five Senses to verify this simple premise , why then does Man thinks that God can trust Man with greater knowledge of God &apos;s existence ? If man questions what he CAN see , and demands that God show himself in order to make Man believe , how then is Man really going to believe ( should God chose to &quot; jump through that hoop &quot; ) when he already questions the SEEN ? With all due respects , Man is a religious being ! Belief toward God or Belief away from God is a presupposed position held-to religiously that rebels against logic tenaciously ! An atheist may call me illogical , but only if he or she is willingly to wear illogical as a moniker , too ! : )
It &apos;s a common religion , not the only religion . Even if there wasn &apos;t a single dominant religion . If there were several thousand religions , if they could live side by side with only minor conflicts , if they had tolerance it would be ok . However that &apos;s only possible with these religions as abrahimic have a looong and thorough history of not being able to get along with those next to it.It &apos;s the mentality of the religions that &apos;s most important . The abrahimic religions feel everybody has to convert to their beliefs ... which is why it is dominant , because they followed that aggresively . The other religions respect other &apos;s and don &apos;t agressively convert others and don &apos;t feel it &apos;s their mission to convert , but more to respect and understand . If religions had that mentality .. then it would definately be a better world and half of these &apos; religion causes wars &apos; bs ideas would go out of the window .
You have to call upon God just try sometime and pray to him and just be yourself have a conversation to with about your worries and ask him to make himself real to you and he will . God doesn &apos;t want to be where he is not welcome he doesn &apos;t want robots thats one of the reason why he gave us a freewill .
I hear you and understand all of those things you mentioned . It &apos;s a theological discussion on why there are so many bad things that happen in the world .
If &quot; it &quot; is used properly it could either mean , life or believing in God.So there are two different questions here ... &amp; gt ; Is life spent believing in God worth the belief in God ? or &amp; gt ; Is life spent believing in God worth life ? I &apos;ll stick with the latter ... This is a value comparison essentially between a persons life , where they do believe , and a person &apos;s life where they don &apos;t believe.There is no way to qualitatively measure the worth of someone &apos;s life without factoring in happiness and suffering . Would the person with no belief in God suffer less than the person with faith ? Would the person with no faith be happier , over all ? I don &apos;t think the question can be answered . No matter which way you look at it , though , it &apos;s life , and there &apos;s nothing greater than life ... Life with or without the belief in a god is still life . Anything beyond that is a value comparison with no way to evaluate each way of life , so if your argument lays claim to any idea of a life or life style &apos;s value it becomes about as valid as you see the belief in God .
sure is , if thats what gets you through the night ; )
So here &apos;s the situation : You live a life of sex , drugs , and partying ( rock n &apos; roll is not a sin ) . You continue to live without God . You die . Now what ? You rot in the ground ? What do you have to live for then ? What would be the meaning of life to you ?
Then that doesn &apos;t answer any questions . Why was life put on Earth ? Why does Earth even exist ? Wouldn &apos;t it make sense to believe in God : He put life on Earth , either directly or indirectly ( I &apos;m not getting into that ) , so that we could live life in order to return to Him . Life is like a trial period . God wants to know how we can act with free will , sin , and detachment from pure good .
Why was life put on Earth ? You &apos;re assuming life was &quot; put &quot; on earth rather than the more obvious answer , that life is a natural occurrence , like gravity . Where you have x and y you get z . Just because there isn &apos;t life EVERYWHERE flying around in little spaceships and shooting lasers at us like &quot; TAKE US TO YOUR LEADER ! ! ! &quot; , doesn &apos;t mean that the universe isn &apos;t teeming with life.Why does Earth even exist ? Does Pluto seem to have a special function , or serve a special purpose for human life ? What about a random planet millions of light years away ? Do you think that it serves mankind ? It &apos;s a selfish and stupid idea , if so . Would your god be happy to know that you &apos;re so full of yourself to assume that everything in existence is FOR you ? Earth is nothing more than a combination of over-abundant material . Why aren &apos;t there more planets like earth then ! ? Think about it this way , when the lights are off in your room at night do you know that there isn &apos;t someone being murdered in Japan ? We don &apos;t have the means to tell if there are planets capable of supporting life , but there are more planets in our solar system , more solar systems in the galaxy and more galaxies in the universe , and maybe more universes ... in the multiverse . There are the same materials all over the place that we can find here on earth , so what &apos;s to keep you from assuming that earth is not the only planet like this in ALL OF EXISTENCE ! ? You probably don &apos;t even know what happened in the 1500 &apos;s , but you seem to know that there has been nothing like earth , ever , in all of time and in the extreme vastness of space ... and then on top of that your planet is the only to support life ever , and then on top of that even , you are 1 out of 498390485038453840589 of the most intelligent beings EVER . That , my friend , is wildly unreasonable .... You &apos;re suggesting that there is a being like man , that created us somehow , that wants to teach us all a lesson so that we can love him ... hrmm
I believe in God , but I consider myself a Deist . I think that he gave me the logic and the power of knowledge to question a lot of things such as this subject that is very debatable . I also think that there should be separation between church and state because the idea of America was to have people worshiping what they wanted . I think people have the right to believe what they want , and if you want to be an Athiest it is fine with me .
Let &apos;s play your game , shall we ... &amp; gt ; So here &apos;s the situation : - &amp; gt ; You live a life of : -- &amp; gt ; sex-- &amp; gt ; drugs-- &amp; gt ; partyingAlright ... - &amp; gt ; You continue to live without GodAlright ... - &amp; gt ; You die.Ok.- &amp; gt ; Now what ? According to observation , the body decomposes.You rot in the ground ? It depends on where you put the body , I guess , or where you die . Most people don &apos;t die in the ground . What do you have to live for then ? Nothing , you just made me assume that I &apos;m dead . Part of living for something is being alive . Dead things aren &apos;t alive , it &apos;s part of it &apos;s definition . What would be the meaning of life for you ? Dead things cannot know the meaning of anything , because they are not conscious . The question wouldn &apos;t be applicable to me either though , because you address me as &quot; you &quot; , which is the way you would address a conscious being that is aware of itself as a component of it &apos;s environment . In fact , it &apos;s odd but you &apos;ve been calling &quot; you &quot; since my death as though I was still alive , even though you were the one that claimed I was dead.Is it our fault that you assume a dead body possesses the capability to answer questions ? ; PIn all seriousness though , you &apos;re asking the wrong questions . When you come to a middle ground for discussion you should be ready enough to know that there are answers that are unlike your own . This isn &apos;t a place for you to preach to everyone .
Yes I think believing in god is worth it because he make the world
Yes because it helps you accept your life ( it &apos;s God &apos;s will . He has a better plan for your life than you . Have faith in him . ) If you accept your life , you wont be all pissed off and your heart would be better off because of that and you should thus live longer .
Well again atheists are going to go the &apos; logical &apos; way and believers will go in the route of &apos; faith &apos; . I myself am a believer so my standing on this issue would be believing in God . The opposing side will be non believers this side will be believers . I mean these debates are so redundent . 1 after the other .
I &apos;m one of those &apos; logical &apos; atheist ...
so congratulations I said nothing durogatory towards atheists or believers did I ? I stated my opinion thats like me saying there are white people and black people and a white guy says &apos; I &apos;m one of those &apos; white &apos; people &apos; what do you want bradford a cookie ?
science has proven that people who have some belief in a diety or higher being live longer , healthier lives , and are more likely to survive a tradgedy ( such as an unexpected death , or fatal disease ) . The study cant tell if in the end what the person believes is actually true , but that doesn &apos;t apply in this case ; just the simple belief that there is more to life than living and dying is enough to make a life more enjoyable .
Is their a Creator or not ? Sometimes I feel we debating vast topics such as this , the first creation and original divine purpose is much like two ants walking a beach arguing how many grains of sand there are and how they got there . They thought the earth was round once you know . All we know by way of science is by experimental . If there was a God , you &apos;d think there &apos;d be a better way . There is . A witness far better than sight . If I may , I &apos;d like to step aside the intellectual bottleneck and offer this simple idea : You can judge a lifestyle by its effects like you can judge a tree by its good or bad fruit . To believe there is no God is to believe in no afterlife because when brain functions end , thats it . End of story . How utterly pointless would it all be then . Whats the point ? There would be none . On the contrary however , if there is God , lets say our Heavenly Father , then there is no end with ceasing of simple brain function . There is much more beyond the veil of our understanding , and we can peak through and know if we are willing to receive it and and act upon it . Another idea is this : Here I am in this body , there you are in yours . That is no accident . There are trillions of living things on this earth . Plants , Bacteria , Animals , etc . But , here you are as a human being with the capacity to think , reason and act ; free will . The apes didn &apos;t have that . I &apos;ve never heard of an ape committing suicide yet Humans do it all the time sadly . I testify that God lives . He is active in our lives and he does manifest himself to us . He has to me and I &apos;m not crazy . There , you have my witness ; dont believe just because you haven &apos;t had the same , because at some time we all will have that experience and all will know the truth . I dont understand all things but this I know . Heres the words of an ancient prophet , see if this is a good answer for those requesting a sign : &quot; 43 And now Korihor said unto Alma : If thou wilt show me a asign , that I may be convinced that there is a God , yea , show unto me that he hath power , and then will I be convinced of the truth of thy words . &quot; 44 But Alma said unto him : Thou hast had signs enough ; will ye tempt your God ? Will ye say , Show unto me a sign , when ye have the testimony of aall these thy brethren , and also all the holy prophets ? The scriptures are laid before thee , yea , and all things denote there is a God ; yea , even the bearth , and call things that are upon the face of it , yea , and its dmotion , yea , and also all the eplanets which move in their regular form do witness that there is a Supreme Creator . &quot; You &apos;ll be surprised at the answers you can find : http : / / www.mormon.org /
Believing in god is important because it gives humanity a reason for existence .
I agree with your rebuttal JB . It makes so much sense . Even though I am a believer in God and my life has been worth living , I don &apos;t often think that God has His eye on me personally . If , at my end , I find there is or isn &apos;t a God , my life will have had the structure of a Christian belief system and the benefit of living for life itself with no particular end .
look i for 1 believe that there is a god but i think that all the gods are the same 1 depicted in different ways.1.now lets say god is not real ok ? and some 1 goes around preaching his name and helping people and giving people hope he is still a good person and will go were every 1 else goes in the end , 2.if god is real and he dose the man / woman dose the same they go to a nice place and get rewarded.and in point &quot; 1 &quot; if that man did not believe in god he would probably not of done those lovely things and helped the world for the better and the only bad thing he would pf done would be talking to himself a few times a day.also lets face it the Cristian view of death is much nicer than the atheist , and it helps people move on when there family dies , so i think beveling in god any god is better than not beveling at all .
I think so . It is always good to have someone we call God in our life . &apos; Refrains you from all those stupid things , that in the end you know , it wont bring any good in your life . It is also better to live the life He leads . We all are entitled to have our own beliefs and nasty things , that &apos;s one of his gifts for us Free will and I have also tried all those things that are considered evil and useless . But eventually I get tired of it . It is not worth it really . So I bring back my faith and start believing in God again . Believing in Him makes me a better person . Or that is just I want to believe . But really , I never have experience before this contentment I &apos;m feeling now and I want to believe that it is because of my faith and belief of Him .
Its sad that the ( no its not side ) is winning , God has made such a great impact on my life IT iS WORTH BELIVING IN HIM ! Are people these days really doubting the belief that there is someone who is more superior than our selves ? The world didnt make its self , and no big bang theorie put the world in the most perfect conditions to where we benefit to every little thing in it. have you ever thought about the structure of a human being , who are you gonna say put that together , the big bang ? Those scientist and their predictions , they aren &apos;t nothing but human beings just as confused as me and you . Humans have the natural tendacy to be curious , so we come up with answer for everything . This is sad , people you need to believe that there is a god . Im not good at making people believers and i really wish i could pursuade you , because through my eyes there is no other reasonable way other than a god that made this world what it is .
yes it is. even if you think we came from different origins , why should we tempt it ? and besides , you get to go to heaven if god is real . ( provided you were faithful ) what do you get with atheism or evolution ? you rot in the ground. fun. whats the point in living if you wont get any perks after ?
it is worth it ... god gives you hope of everlasting life and you don &apos;t just rot in the ground nothing after you know all that jazz you say there is a thing called resurection people !
In my point of view it is. yes we may not see God but i dont think life was just an accident , I view life as a test that we either fail or win . The consequence of failing the test , breaking the rules or just trying to cheat our way out is eternity in hell . The treasure of suffering , going through stumbles and believing without seeing but by living by faith results in eternal life in heaven , by trustong God when things seem unreasonable or like a joke we show God just how much we really want to get to be with him by paying the price which is being viewed as a weirdo and being disliked by others for his cause
You know a lot of people go to the color blue after my first post on this website = &#93; I got murdered for that comment me and Xaeon had a page of arguments with eachother woooo good times good times.You can prove that the sky is blue by consulting text books you must BELIEVE in god = &#93; not a direct quote but pretty close
we are only human how do we know what sience is. sience could be god working .
Hey thanks for looking through it . I guess it &apos;s good to find something to laugh at every once and a while .
There are so many things that we know exist that are immaterial . Take , for example , love , which almost all of us have experienced . We know that this exists , and it is not a material substance , so it would have a similar explanation as the existence of God would . And in the time of Jefferson , there was air , but nobody could explain it . They couldn &apos;t see it or capture it and they felt it was not a material . Of course , by now we know the details to what air is made of , but back then , this would have been just as mysterious as the existence of God or love .
If it is a question ask your self . If it is an argument only time will explain you clearly .
It &apos;s called Paschal &apos;s Wager . Let &apos;s say you live a religious / moral life , then there are four results : 1 . You believe in God . He exists . You get to go to Heaven ! 2 . You believe in God . He doesn &apos;t exist . Nothing happens ( rot in ground ) .3 . You don &apos;t believe in God . He doesn &apos;t exist . Nothing happens ( rot in ground ) .4.You don &apos;t believe in God . He does exist . You go to Hell . Eternal suffering ! Yeah ! Therefore , wouldn &apos;t your odds on the afterlife be better if you DO believe in God ?
I don &apos;t look at it as an end-all be-all to religion . I see it as a way to get others to understand what might happen if they don &apos;t believe in God . After this , people tend to find other reasons to believe . Pacals &apos;s Wager is simply a way to show that believing in God IS worth it .
I understand it &apos;s difficult to see who the true god is . It all involves faith . I have faith that I worship the right God . It &apos;s not as if ALL non-believers will go straight to hell . I feel , however , that God is a universal entity that causes us to want to do good . No matter what religion you practice , God ( or gods ) is there to make us all act moral . I believe that if somebody lives a good moral life , he can be rewarded in Heaven . However , I learned that Heaven has different levels , as does Hell . I would think that believing in God would enable passage into a level closer to God in Heaven .
I have faith because I have experienced the peace that comes through God . I &apos;m not saying I &apos;ve seen miracles , but I go to morning mass at my school in the mornings . I feel more peaceful on those days than I ever do in any other situation . God is a universal entity in that no matter what culture you are talking about , there is a notion of a supreme being . It &apos;s human nature to believe so . It &apos;s just that as time progressed , we realized that there really isn &apos;t a god for everything , like in polytheistic religions . Instead , we have God who watches over us . He allows the world to run on its own and makes sure good things come out of evil acts . And what else would compel people to do good . I want to do good , primarily , so that I can feel a sense of pride in myself . After this , I also feel I owe it to God to help others the way he has helped me . Even in ancient religions , people acted morally in order to avoid the wrath of their gods . They also sacrificed animals , etc , but that was culture specific .
Oh hey , I missed this.You might be forgetting that guidance is help .
When Moses encountered God he had the good sense to ask him his name.The burning bush replied , &quot; I am who am . &quot; God was sending a message through the ages to us today . Today , we are searching for the underlying power that ties everything together , the string theory , the quantum matrix , dark energy , and the &quot; god &quot; particle.The &quot; dark energy &quot; that we now theorize is the matrix that holds the universe in place is the essence of God &apos;s concienceness . God is the matrix . His son is the human embodiment of his power and has existed before creation , though he was born of a young woman 2000 years ago.A mystery , not so much , quantum theory now tells us that time is not as real as we percieve . We know that matter can exist in many places at once . So then it follows that man and God can do it as well . Therefor God can be born in 3 AD , but have existed at creation . In fact , creation , the birth and death of Christ , and the Revelation can occur simultaneously.What physcisist are trying to find is the ultimate cause , but the burning bush gave us that answer thousands of years ago in the desert.It is possible CERN may solve the riddle and yield the &quot; God &quot; particle and in doing so it may also open the door to heaven , ------it may be that in this time , God wants us to find him ------ again !
And why , precisely , it is on the person proposing the existence of an object . If you propose a pink elephant is floating above my head , it doesn &apos;t mean that you must therefore prove it . I can live my life as if there is a floating invisible pink elephant , or I can live my life as if there is no elephant . If you believe all believers in any deities require a change of behavior from the world , then you are mistaken.You originally defined athiest as &quot; the denial that supernatural beings exist &quot; and went on to posit that since most individuals profess to one single religion and deny all others , they are already atheists . This is inconsistent with your definition . Despite my disbelief in Zeus , or more accurately , my unwillingness to change my behavior to reflect the validity of the assumption that Zeus exists , I still may believe in other deities . Also , you &apos;re assuming that every religious person approaches their own belief with a lack of skepticism , uncritically and wholly . This is simply untrue . Look over this site and you &apos;ll see examples of people examining the ideas of faith , but still remaining faithful . From your last post , with the fear of eternal punishment reference , I believe you may have confused &quot; Theist &quot; with &quot; Christian &quot; . Please do not equate &quot; Belief in a God &quot; with &quot; Belief in Hell &quot; .
What Pyrus said . The Bible is proof of His existence .
He is not because if he was , WoW would not have a shaman or Paladi class . Aso whe you do the soulja boy you only get a pickel .
God existwhy are we here if he doesnt exsite
God is alive , and works miracles all over the world . I know for sure that when i die , i will live with him in heaven because i believe jesus died for us and i love god and trust in him . I proudly say I am a Christian .
If god wasn &apos;t real , why are we alive . / If you say cavemen , then what created the caveman / &gt; Any other theories , just ask yourself how was it created
God does exist .. maybe people dont believe in god because of thier religion but god exists ..
GOD DOES EXIST ! ! Maybe your thinking that then why God does not protect us . That reason is not all Gods are good . Some are EVIL . Also when I ask God for help like getting a good grade , the next several days I get a good grade ! ! &#91; &#91; B : text
God has been around a lot longer than this debate !
There is a god who always helps us.your saying there is no proof that god exits then who created the earth , platnets and heavens.i am sure that mankind cannot create all these.so GOD DOES EXITS .
God does exist because I exist , and I felt his love and received the Holy Spirit . I &apos;m the proof of his existance because I believe in him and he wants me to live strongly no matter how many evil and horrible events circulate around the world . Also , why did so many people sacrifice their lives just to spread the word full of love from Christ , even today ? And think of the opposite : Why do so many people rail against God a lot ? The world will fall apart , but God stands for all eternity .
OK , so you think god doesn &apos;t exist ? Where is the proof for it ? Anyway , there is proof that he exists . Search in any good images site for &apos; the eye of god &apos; and look at the results . There is an eye in the sky .
Let me guess ... Dawkins said it , you believe it , that settles it ? / / &gt; People like you who claim that God DOESN &quot; T exist just because YOU SAY SO are no different than those who claim that God DOES existg because THEY SAY SO . / &gt; / &gt; God exists , but not because I say so . I say so because it &apos;s the truth .
Well ... as you know ... / If you don &apos;t believe in God .. / &gt; / &gt; It &apos;s simple ... / &gt; / &gt; Ur a / &gt; / &gt; / &gt; SATANIST ! ! ! ! ! ! !
HOW DO YOU KNOW ? Have you done some searching of the heavens and earth and now somehow you know more then the rest of us , because you seen it all . That is simply impossible ... Sorry .
There is also no proof that he DOESN &apos;T exist !
I believe in God , but I also pride my ability to reason . I don &apos;t think either conflict at this point .
How can you explain everything on earth . It got here somehow . I mean , its your choice to believe in him .
Hey ... Wait . There is little proof for or against god . And Does it really matter ? Hey- yes . I believe in a god . Doesn &apos;t mean I believe in everything associated with a god ( such as an afterlife ) , but i believe in god . Just as an ... Observer
God is just made up ... If he were real he would just go and prove it ...
I do believe that God is there ...
God does exist . For the ones who don &apos;t believe just look around God is the only one who could make this world people are dumb for thinking other wise people believe what they read in their history books but yet they weren &apos;t here when it happened God is real and non-believers will learn sooner or later
How can you agree with that there is advance all around us every female has one gene that is the same they found were moses devised the red sea it goes like _ _ _ ------- _ _ _ _ _ _ in the water how was the grand canon formed the great flood duh i want some thing that proofs he is not real because it will back fire on you and i will make it work for me studie him and you will believe you will not be able to stop your self i am a strong believer and I &apos;m only 13 wow how about those apples and one day i hope you all believe not my word but his be done ( bible i don &apos;t know were through )
I believe God exists ... Because ... / / &gt; I want something to hope for other than being a machine suggested by evolution . / &gt; / &gt; Prophecies from the Bible are ever so being fulfilled . Like Israel returning as a nation ( remember the Walk in WWII ? &#91; and hebrew as the only language to have fully died off and revive ) / &gt; / &gt; Because I have had way too many complications with the varied evolutionary theories . ( I used to be an atheist goth , mind you ) / &gt; / &gt; And btw a trend of the age is new age or matrixism because its &apos; cool &apos; . / &gt; / &gt; ( I hope i put a few good respectable reasons )
Thank you God , that I exist , that everybody exist , that this whole world exists . God is real . / For sure .
Yes God exists , there is evidence that he exists . Enough evidence for the open minded to call it proof beyond a reasonable doubt . But there is still some faith involved . Likewise you have to have faith in athiesm in order to ignore the evidence and not believe in god . One bit of evidence for God is the creation of the universe . &quot; the big bang &quot; theory is generally accepted by scientists today . So all time , space and matter had a beginning at some time in the distant past . Before the big bang there was no time space or matter . Christians say God ( an infinate being outside of time space and matter ) created something out of nothing . Athiests say nothing created something out of nothing . Both views require some faith , but the christian view makes more logical sense and requires less faith . Creation of life on earth is more evidence that points to god ( intelegent design ) . Athiests , darwinists , evolutionists claim that uninteligent , randomizing nature took dead random matter and mixed it together and first life was born . Then every living thing evolved from that first life . Of corse christians think God created man , the animals , and the vegitation . The fossil records show that all life appeared between 600million and 500million bc , and that all life appeared all at once , fully formed , and showed no directional changes through extinction . The fossil records also do not show any transitional forms to support evolution . Again we cannot go back and witness what happened so some faith is required , but the evidence agrees more strongly with creation rather than evolution / athieism / darwinism . And there is much more evidence pointing to God , but if you rule out God to begin with , then all the evidence in the world will never provide &quot; proof &quot; that God exists
Ok ... I got drug over here by the moderators so now I have to vote . / / &gt; Yes , God exists .
I believe that a sentient and unseen power exists--like a cosmic awareness . That is what I think of as God . And I can believe this God exists without believing IN God to DO anything . And I do not have to be religious or even have a religion to think this . And the God that may exist may not be like the biblical version at all . But we all have a source beyond the physical realm , I think . We should respect this source in some way , simply for giving us our existence .
Quit confusing Christians and Muslims with everyone who believes in God . It &apos;s offensive .
Yes i do believe in god or the concept of god under a universal way . What i mean is that a see god in all animals and humans this togetherness that we all have to me is god . Now correct me if i am wrong for the people that do not believe there is a god . Do you not believe In the Eurocentric version of god which is this evil god that destroy the non believers because I may not know what god is but i know what god not
I think God is real because if it weren &apos;t for God how would you have been born huh ? And you might say evolution er sum stupid stuff like that and that all leads up to a big bang but big bangs don &apos;t just happen ..... something has to cause them so what do you think ? There is no scientific explanation for how the big bang happened but it did and you people who say God doesn &apos;t exist need to look at yourself and think how could any of this happen without something to make it happen ? Big bangs don &apos;t just come flyin outta people &apos;s asses !
I believe that God exists .
Well there has been many a convert on the battlefield , in the moments between the saddle and the ground .
Yes , He does . From the athiest viewpoint , the universe exists basically by accident . This is a point of view I will never understand . The world &apos;s too complicated and works too well to have sprung out of nowhere because of a chemical reaction .
God obviously exists .. Everything in the world needs a creator .. Like a watchmaker makes watches .. If we look around the beauty of this world .. There can only be one thing that could have created this .. And that &apos;s
GOD does exist ! If you pray for something and you don &apos;t get at all or right away , does that mean that God don &apos;t exist , No ! It just means that maybe you are not supposed to receive it or not at the moment . It &apos;s like when you were little and you asked your parents for something and they said no or not yet maybe for Christmas , does that mean your parents aren &apos;t real , No ! / &gt; K9 , God can raise someone from the dead and has before , He has also healed people from all sorts of things . Believing is not seeing it is the evidence of things not seen ! Pray and ask God to reveal Himself to you and see what happens !
Within your question you have two major assumptions that are false ... First of all , you assume that God can contradict himself , which is logically impossible.Let me state for the record , God absolutely cannot contradict himself . If you think you see a contradiction , check your premises . God created a world where people had freedom and free will . Hence , it follows logically that God cannot create people with absolutely free will without the possibility that people might choose evil . Secondly , you assume humans and God share the same definition of &quot; good . &quot; You say that if a person is in poverty that is bad . Yes and no . It is true that they may lead an exceptionally painful existence , but God &apos;s measure of good is how many people accept him freely and enter heaven . If the only way a particular person might turn to God is through suffering , then that suffering was good . Since while the short term suffering may seem terrible , it is nothing compared to an eternity away from God .
Your response shows exactly the type of limited exposure to research that I previously spoke of . I do not have enough time nor space to enumerate a list of published work here , but if you are interested in broadening your knowledge , then have a look at some of the peer reviewed works mentioned at http : / / www.discovery.org / scripts / viewDB / index.php ? command = view &amp; id = 2640 &amp; program = CSC % 20- % 20Scientific % 20Research % 20and % 20Scholarship % 20- % 20Science . On another point , making arbitrary assumptions about individuals in a mocking fashion on open forums such as this one is completely unnecessary and does not aid your credibility in any way . This site is about informed opinions , not people trying to be witty . I suggest reading through those articles in the link I provided and then forming an objective opinion of intelligent design instead of mistakenly referring to it as &quot; Wishful thinking &quot; and implying that it is not credible research .
I suspect there is a &quot; God &quot; or a first cause we have named God . However , human explanations that come in dogmatic presentations from organized religions can never be proven nor dis proven . As the above article states , &quot; GOD creates everything , there is no way that the created being can think about the CREATOR . &quot; Yet we have a Bible , a Koran , and countless others all claiming to be the revealed word of God .... can they all be correct ? When humans do find out which explanation is the real and true one let us all hope it is similar to the Janis explanation , since they seem to have the more benevolent view of this entity we have named God .
Ignorance is not evident ? Well apparently it is because it &apos;s showing up all over your comment . : ) Ok . Just a &apos; breaking the ice &apos; kind of intro . Jesus Christ dealt with men / women like you very often during His time here on earth . I could in many manners reprimend you but suggesting an alternative belief for you in the &apos; Crishtianity &apos; realm is obviously not what you are trying to here ; therefore , we &apos;ll just let Jesus do it later . ( another funn ) : ) God Bless even you--
It appears that you see God as a punisher rather than a redeemer . I see Him as the source of all that is good in this world and beyond . Here , we struggle in our lives to live with limitations which keep us from viewing the truth without the shadows of the flesh . God sent His only Son to enter into our humanity , so that we could enter into His Spirit- and live . He is transforming us from being mere creatures , into children with life breathed into them , and preparing us for true union . God made the rocks , trees and all that exists here- but people are different . Yes , people create lots of God , and somehow struggle against the only true God who asks that we be willing to give up all others . He is looking for hearts that seek Him , because He knows the better end in store . Free will allows us to choose the pastures that satisfy us with earthly things . But while here , we get glimmers of the better things of the Spirit . I actually do understand your outlook . I know it will insult you if I tell you that I will pray for you , so let me just wish you well in your search or avoidance . It is your choice to believe that this is all there is or not . The key to transforming love , which is what God desires , is that it is reciprocal . But He allows us to make our own choices . He has already expressed the greatest love through Jesus Christ . That is not vain or petty . That is sacrifice that invites us all to free , unrestrained and eternal truth . There is no coercion.God bless
pbeaird , indeed . That is no argument from ignoracne but one acknowledging all the failed arguments for God in line with the auto-epistemic rule . The presumption of naturalism reflects that not only are natural causes and explanations efficient but also necessary , primary and sufficient . They , contrary to Gottfried Wilhem Leibniz , are the sufficient reason . This neither sanbags theist nor begs the question but demands evidence as Einstein so did to overcome Newton . Science explains the how and the why . The why is not according to a pre-arranged plan &#91; the atelic challenge &#93; but according to natural forces , including those random ones . So those are indeed primary causes ; one cannot then declare God the primary cause and them the secondary ones . As our naturalist arguments are defeasible , then there is probably no God .
Christians are not burdened to prove what they know . You feel no burden to seek answers with an open mind , and that is your choice . That lack of interest or belief on your part should not be used as an argument that God doesn &apos;t exist . Those who believed in a trade route around a round world didn &apos;t make it true by proving it . Our world was round despite the proof or lack of . It wasn &apos;t flat till proven round . It was simply believed to be round by those who refused to accept the possibility that there was evidence in the stars that we rotated , leading some to accurately come to the conclusion that the earth is round . I would suggest that your unwillingness to examine the mysteries that would be explained by a Creator God , may indicate an error in the scientific method . You are willing to accept that some things defy science , or can &apos;t be explained by science , but you are unwilling to rationalize that ANY explanation that fully explains the mystery could be true . Like the flat earthers , you require proof , when the very universe testifies of God .
Faith IS truly required to believe ( i.e. KNOW in one &apos;s heart ) that God exists . Yet , Faith in faith alone gives little comfort that Faith will one Day be proven to be fact . Faith THAT God exists is based on the presuppositions that God can exist , and that His existence is beneficial to me.However , by the same token Faith is required to believe that God does NOT exist ! The Faith that God does NOT exist is based on the presuppositions that the Universe can exist even if God does not , and that the lack of God is in some way or ways beneficial to me.Though I will probably add another comment later , I will close this one with an investment-return analysis ! Belief : God exists ! Investment : This Life with all its problems &amp; blessings ... on average 100 years or less . Return : Eternity of significant existence minus problems plus additional favor for believers.Belief : God does not exist ! Investment : Time &amp; Effort getting to the top of your field , and the staggering task of proving your own omniscience of all things in order to be able to prove that God does not exist ! Return : A Life of pleasures that lasts for 100 years or less , and the possibility of being immortalized in the hearts of those who adore you , even though YOU yourself cease to exist.Cost-Benefits Analysis shows heavier value on the side of Belief in God and His certain existence ! ( Hebrews 11 : 1 , KJV ) It &apos;s not even close ! : )
If you really are searching for some answers to this question then I can provide great books that break down the philosophical side of free will . One of the most well known on this issue is C.S. Lewis , &quot; The problem of pain . &quot; He also wrote mere &quot; Christianity &quot; and &quot; Miracles . &quot; You are right in saying that there is no absolute proof of how life came about . However keep in mind , &quot; Science doesn &apos;t provide us with truth . The practice of scientific investigation involves tools that help us explain how the physical world might work . The explanation doesn &apos;t have to be true to be useful , just consistent with most of the evidence . &quot; ( Spencer ) . The evidence when studied just facts points towards a designer . Chance is ruled out through mathematical probability . For more on this read Robert Collins , Jay W. Richards , or Guillermo Gonzalez . For scientific evidence in molecular biology read Michael Behe , and Johnathan Wells . I would encourage reading opposing view from evolution scientist such a Ruse . It is good to know why you choose you evidences . The energy mass you speak of is called the singularity . Both sciences believe in the &quot; big bang &quot; It is a measurable event . The argument is evolution believes that nothing came from nothing to create something over billions of years . There can be no infinity . &quot; Everything that begins the exist has a cause , The earth began to exist , therefore it has a cause . &quot; If you heard a bang in the next room and asked me what was that and i said nothing , you would not except that . The bang has a cause . The idea that something comes into existence un-caused is absurd . Thank you for your time
You wrote : &quot; Given the lack of proof , in scientific terms , either way , those who do not believe in God may actually be faithful equally to those who do believe in God , only their faith is in the lack of a God . &quot; Although I agree with what you &apos;re saying , why do we continue to run to science for validation of our beliefs ? There are things that science cannot do . Scientific knowledge has proven to be false in many instances ... by science itself . Science is limited to areas of naturalism-- it CAN &apos;T prove or disprove the SUPERnatural . I say , let &apos;s run to the principles of jurisprudence , where probability is honored . I believe BEYOND ALL REASONABLE DOUBT that God exists .
Since Unified Force Theory fits the basic definition of God . The question is , when people say they believe in God , what do they mean by God ?
You are both ducking the question . Ok , one true God , Yahweh , and a lot of mythical wantabes . But what is God ? When we say we believe in God , what is he .
This ties in nicely with my perception of there only being NOW . The past is forever gone except for &quot; memories &quot; ( not so reliable memories ) I NOW have and the future has not arrived except for hopes and plans I have NOW that it will arrive in a way I would like it to . But in reality I wave only this milli micro moment to DO anything that might create a future NOW.As the bible put it.These three remain FAITH - that what I now think I remember actually was HOPE - that what I wantand am now planning will actually occurand LOVE and the greatest of these is love because it is what I can do NOW based on my memory of a past to create the future I am hoping will come into existence .
I never made such an assumption ... We cannot even assume God exists , less so that He is the creator of all we know and the unknown . If God exists , He or She or IT may in fact have ordered existing matter but the problem lies in explaining who created matter BEFORE the supreme Being and how can a Being be Supreme if it came into existence after matter !
It isn`t clear and it does raise more questions than answers since there is no definitive answer ... only limiting questions about an unlimited thesis .
29 May 2009 I like what you had to say about God . What you need to understand is that many people really do not want to know the truth because it would require them to do some soul searching of their own . It is easier to blame God for the ills of the world than to research one &apos;s soul and take a good hard look at ourselves . How could there be good w / o bad , right w / o wrong , life w / o death ? Remember whenever we become full of ourselves we open the door to true evil , Satan . God wants us to love him because we want to , not because we have to , ie free will . In today &apos;s society too much importance is put on money and material things in my humble opinion . There are people who do not consider themselves poor , although by others standards most likely would be considered poor . If you believe in God , you must also know that Satan is his rival , and will do what it takes to attempt to dehumanize humans in the eyes of other humans . God won &apos;t fall for it however many humans will and do . I believe that there are millions of tragedies in this world that could be easily laid at Satan &apos;s door . He loves to see people ponder over whether there is a God , it is his mission . We do have choices in this world , whether or not people see that have choices or not is another story . To simply do nothing is a choice , and if Satan can keep us reacting instead of acting , he has us on the fence post . For me God does exist because when I look back over my life , and I see the many times God was there for me when no one else was . It would not have mattered if I had a lot or money or none , because I was in the hospital on machine that was breathing for me . They were pumping me full of morphine / paralytic drugs so I would remain still because I was told I was fighting the machine to breath on my own . It took me 3 months to be able to get my arms , legs , and hands to function properly . I remember walking around in Walmart for 3 hours trying to gain strengh in my legs . The wonder of it all was I didn &apos;t remember hardly any of it , until I was told . What I remembered was praying in a safe place within myself . I saw my life and my loved ones lives and how much I loved them . I spoke with a woman whom I &apos;m told no one ever saw in my room , yet she was with me all the time . I saw good times and sad times , and things I could have done differently in my past , and a chance to do them differently in the future . I saw violence and dispair and death whirl around me yet I was not afraid . It is okay with me if others choose to believe God does not exist , probably wouldn &apos;t be able to change their minds no matter what I said . I could have easily died in that hospital , but God had other plans , my daughter and my grandchildren needed me to be here for them , which I am . I am with my family , and to me that is worth more than any dollar value . We are not rich , we are not poor , however that is in terms of dollars and cents , we are rich in many other ways . I hope that what I have shared with you will make you think back over your lives , wonder what you might find . Thank you for reading my missive , it is longer than I had planned it to be . Sincerely lfschrawyer
the obvious logical sequence .
You shouldn &apos;t give orders to people you don &apos;t know , or anybody for that matter . If you want to learn about the Bible , I suggest you get one and read it yourself . It was not written by the same man at the same time , but with study you will find it relates to today &apos;s world as much as it did 2000 years ago . It does so in an order you will discover if you read it instead of baiting others for arguments .
Don &apos;t get so defensive . Quantum is OK the one you have to watch out for is Book .
And I know who wrote it . I &apos;m just saying , you assert something about the book , you should probably explain it.If I said that the secret of life was found in old tapes of Captain Kangaroo , I would be , at the least , rude to not tell you what the secret of life is and how I found it .
I do believe there is a higher power that most people would refer to as God . My Interpretation stems from intelligence and how we understand the world around us and then to the higher levels of intelligences . For example my dog is a wonderful pet , but he does have a lower intelligence than me . He experiences the world very differently than me . Am I a God to him ? I think to him we would be . If we didn &apos;t know better if a alien race came down to this planet and had intelligence that we did not understand would they be a God ? In ancient history probably yes , watch Chariots of Fire . Nowadays thats a tough one , we have a much better understanding of what intelligence is . If God walked the earth would he cease to be God ? I think it boils down to intelligence and the authority that intelligence perceives to have . Last thought intelligence a entity born out of energy derived from a source called GOD . We all possess a piece of it , that we have to grow to return back to the source .
God created a earth with just 1 sun and no other stars , would it be a little lame ? would you think it more likely or less likely that there be an intelligent creator ? i &apos;m thinking you &apos;re sugguesting that it would be more likely. now why would you think it more likely that a lame God exists ? these arguments are illogical and nonsensical , and you should realize this . The fact is they are unintelligent , arrogant , and &apos; presumptions . &apos; If you look at the Bible , what is stressed is wisdom , and honesty and humility .. here you lack all three .
&quot; All we can see , measure , and know shows us that matter and energy have always existed . &quot; The author &apos;s statement above simply is not accurate . Big Bag theory , while certainly not an established fact , is widely accepted . According to that theory , matter as we know it did not exist prior to the Big Bang . Indeed , the physical laws of the universe that we are so familiar with did not exist . We cannot know what laws prevailed because the conditions prior to the Big Bang are beyond all experience and , so far at least , are untestable . One may well deny the Big Bang and that &apos;s fine , but the statement that matter and energy have always existed is not supported .
Citing the law of conservation of mass-energy against God / creatio ex nihilo is absurd . The law only applies after the Big Bang ; in all likelihood energy conservation was violated at the Big Bang. http : / / web.archive.org / web / 20031106212441 / http : / / www.astronomycafe.net / qadir / ask / a11609.html
That law , the conservation of mass-energy exhibits itself in two ways : one , therefore their cannot be absolute contingency- no Esistence -as the contingency argument so requires ; two , it exhibits itself in quantum energy , whence comes matter-energy . So here , science indeed does exhibit no reason to posit a dvine creator Science finds no cosmic teleology- no preordained plans for events in Existence . Thus arises the atelic argument that therefore one cannot posit God as behind events . To posit God as somehow involved would be the new Omphalos argument that God hides Himself as the epistemic distance argument would endorse in effect . John L. Schellenberg observes that that distance reflects His hiddenness so much that He probably doesn &apos;t exist !
Science teaches that there is a First Cause that is infinite and beyond observation . In other words what most people call God . Forget religion . Think of the universe as a large pool of energy . Every action or thought causes energy , ripples across the pond , the butterfly effect . Creation is the interaction of all the ripples .
All we realize only exists in our mind .
&quot; If I carry a ball up to the top of a hill does it gain mass ? &quot; The ball or the hill ? &quot; Does a photon have mass ? &quot; No .
Scientists are in near unanimous agreement that the universe came into being roughly 14 billion years ago , and all current evidence supports this theory.The discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation is the primary piece of evidence for the &quot; big bang theory . &quot;
Your argument fails to disprove at all the existence of a God who rules BY those laws . Also- whereas science itself claims itself incomplete , you can never absolutely claim that all laws are ever violated , because many laws lay undiscovered . Also , you fail claim to the petitio principi fallacy . You are only disproving a God that breaks natural laws , not the God that created natural laws , or the God that rules by them . Also- your definition inherently contradicts this argument , because you allow for a God that has been &quot; created , &quot; therefore allowing for a God that did not creat the matter of the universe . You &apos;re basically falling prey to giant straw-man fallacy . You build a God , and then disprove that God . If I defined atheism as &quot; belief that nothing exists outside of the self , &quot; then , depending on your metaphysics , I could easily disprove that . But I do not . As long as the theist must disprove the atheist &apos;s definition of atheism , so also must the atheist disprove the theist &apos;s God .
jdefriez , yes indeed , science is provisional- our best knowledge now , ever subject to revision . Theists cannot say that God violates those laws , as you say , we discover more . You use the petitio to assume that there is this God who made those laws ! We naturalists ever disprove God but the burden is upon theists to reveal Him . We do have naturalist arguments against Him - the problem of Heaven , the hiddennes problem , the atelic challenge , the presumption of naturalism and the ignostic-Ockham . The law of the conservation of mass-energy , as I show elsewhere in these pages , reflects eternal Existence in the form of quantum fluctuations , whence matter-energy as David Mills exhibits in &apos; Atheist Universe . &quot; William Sahakian would claim that we atheists commit the fallacy of multiple questions in askig : what caused this First Cause and what designed the Designer but rather it theists who beg the question and special plead to exempt Him from those two questions ! That bane !
You are obviously much more intellectually minded than I am at this point , but I relate that to years of life rather than my beliefs or views on religion and life . You say that there is a different in belief and conviction . Isn &apos;t it in true conviction that we find belief in something ? Right now I sit in a chair , convinced it will hold me up . I &apos;ve never studied a chair I don &apos;t know exactly why or how long chairs will hold people up , but I believe that I am safe . So I think that conviction and belief are closer and strongly related than you might suppose . If you go bungee jumping how do you know the cable will hold you up ? They have broken before ... Is this conviction ? Or belief ? Using what you stated as belief being a wish and conviction being logic , I would have to say that thinking it to be held would be both . You wish it to hold but you also know it will . &quot; &#91; Religion &#93; stunts one &apos;s consciousness and tears it in two , attributing one &apos;s best to the non-existent and requiring one regard oneself as sacrificial fodder for the benefit of others . &quot; I must say , personally , that I do not regard myself as sacrificial fodder , but perhaps , you have the crusades or suicide bombers in mind ? Both of these I don &apos;t defend as I can &apos;t possibly say they were ever justified in any ways.You speak about true happiness . &quot; One can find true happiness here on earth while we live . &quot; What would you define as true happiness ? Having lots of money ? A pleasant relationship with your spouse ? Having as your profession something you had always wanted to do , and that you love ? I obviously don &apos;t have the answer , but perhaps you have some ideas ? You must have been thinking of some things when you wrote it . Like I said , I don &apos;t have the answers ( that &apos;s why I feel we have to look outside ourselves for them ) but I think that as long as we strive to have true happiness for ourselves we shall never , ever be happy . &quot; You can find happiness now by rejecting the moral code of your religion and discovering the rational moral code of Objectivism , which briefly put says your life belongs to you and the good is to live it rationally . &quot; Ah , so is this true happiness ? You say to reject the moral code . For my religion ( Christianity ) that would mean rejecting love , obedience to authority , unselfishness , etc . Good things in my opinion , and yours too I would think . So forgive me if I cannot fully grasp your meaning . While were recommending books I would like to recommend Mere Christianity by CS Lewis . I found it rather intellectually stimulating and think you might too . If you do end up reading it , I hope you would with an open mind as I will when I read the books you suggested .
We can &apos;t fully place our faith in science , because it is continually changing . The theory &apos;s and truth &apos;s of 100 years ago are not always considered truth 100 years into the future . I think it is questionable to fully rely on the thoughts and beliefs of man for we have not obtained full knowledge and will never obtain full knowledge of all things . There will always be unexplained matters in our existence . It &apos;s almost like we are lost on a weird country road , but do not want to stop and ask for directions because we want to do it ourselves . Although we may never find it and it would be a more pleasant experience if we stopped and asked for directions , we want to see it with our own eyes , so we never stop thinking we might be heading in a totally wrong direction .
Your premise for this argument has not even been proved . You presuppose the fact that God transcends natural laws when many religions believe that God rules by natural laws that transcend Him . This is your fundamental failure in all the arguments provided , which means , in essence , all of your arguments fail .
jdefriez , your premise that &quot; many religions believe that God rules by natural laws that transcend Him , &quot; reflects the fact that your religion , where He makes those laws , reflects in turn your petitio that He does overcome them . So He cannot overrule the law of the coservation of mass-energy that reflects eternal Existence .
One thing the Bible does is validate itself over and over . Not too long ago , scientist looking at the soil underneath the amazon were amazed when they discovered a sudden shift in the soil and the only explanation they had was that the earth had to come to a complete stop for that shift to happen . They did their dating and it dated back to when God stopped the sun in the book of joshua . Weird . Also , scientist used Hezekiahs tunnel as proof that God didn &apos;t exist , until they found it .
What is the basis of scientific &quot; proof &quot; ? Experiments that produce the same results tested by various people right ? If you give religion the same benefit of proving itself by this way then there are millions upon millions of people who experience god and therefore have proven his existence . Now many people experience him in a different way but we have to , I think , chalk it up a lot to culture and ideas about what he is . Some people are actually incapable of experiencing god because they lack the prerequisites usually sucked out of them by a lifetime of incredulity . Or in some cases never there in the first place . I &apos;d like to give an example . My mathematics professor was once asked by a colleague how he could believe in god and still be such a logical person . His reply was more or less along these lines , &quot; I &apos;d explain it to you but you couldn &apos;t understand in the time we have . &quot; &quot; Why not ? &quot; &quot; Could we pull someone off the street and explain to them complex number theory until they understood it as well as we do ? Of course not , they need a basis to start from . &quot; Besides , science lives off of faith I wouldn &apos;t start to decry it . Has anyone seen a quark ? What is a quark made of ? There &apos;s my two cents .
Science teaches that in the beginning the Unified Force , an infinite , unknowable force , split into the strong force , the weak force , and electromagnetism , creating the universe . An infinite , unknowable force creates the universe . Sound familiar ?
Much of the understanding of scientific logic here is incorrect . The very laws of physics are based on theory . We can measure but based on presuppositions . For example : we know that gravity existence , but we presuppose the theory &apos;s of how gravity came into being . Thus Gravity is still a theory . Through Physics we have discovered that the earth is fine tuned for life to exist . Mathematically life elsewhere is improbable There are very few facts of science much more theories . Perhaps there needs to be studying more on these aspects and let the evidence lead you to a conclusion rather than searching for a conclusion to meet your belieifs . There is good research by Michael Behe &quot; irreducible complexity &quot; , and the Robin Collins &quot; Fine tuning . &quot; If there is going to be a debate there needs to be a better knowledge of scientific exploration and theory . Some scientist to read- Michael Ruse ( evolution ) , David Berlinski , Rick Larson , Gregory a . Boyd , Johnathan Wells
&quot; No , I say it &apos; is true &apos; because the evidence strongly suggests that it is true . &quot; What evidence ? &quot; I find it rather interesting that you would name &quot; Debating Design &quot; then go on to talk about the flagellum ... when one of the essays in Debating Design demonstrates how that flagellum is &apos; irreducibly complex &apos; . &quot; Whats your point ? &quot; Yes , but also not very accurate . We do not know how variable gravity can be , it may be that there are only a few possible values for gravity to have . Saying that because we exist gravity must have this value is not a reasonable statement ... rather we exist because gravity has that value . &quot; Yes , fantastic so we agree . Gravity is only one of the many examples . And your argument on gravitation is what Collins is saying . Gravity has its exact value , Therefore we exist . Its a measurable parameter . &quot; I have never been a supporter of the &quot; Rare Earth Hypothesis &quot; Supporter or not , the evidence is there. and finally a challenge to you . Tell me what of life &apos;s origins ? Where and how did life com about ?
Saying that science disproves god is an asinine statement . What has science proven that the earth revolves around the sun and that all living things are made of atoms and such. religion has never claimed to have the answers of why things are the way they are . Holy scriptures are written by man and they transform it as they see fit . But this is not definite proof that there is no god. science can only prove what is seen . There are many things going on in the universe that are unseen look at black holes we know they are there but we can only speculate on how they function . As far as science has gone it is really only within the scope of our corner of our galaxy . Which is a tiny fraction of the whole universe . We see things on such a small scale that most of the things we have proven may not conform to the rest of the universe . We don &apos;t even know what is at the very bottom of our own oceans how can we claim that we know if there is a divine being or not . There is no proof on either side just because there is a god does not disprove science and vice-versa . As speculated ( and i mean a theory that is currently trying to be proven ) the universe is moving apart . Scientist have known this for a long time the universe is expanding right now but they assumed that one day that the universe would collapse in on itself . Scientists now believe that the universe is expanding and will continuing expanding for eternity since gravity loses its strength the farther objects get from each other ( duh ) . So this puts a big question on the big bang theory . Scientists believed that the mass that existed before the big bang was from the universe before and that it collapsed in on itself . And since our universe seems doomed to expand forever it seems that this first explanation will not fit the mold . So what was before that mass that the big bang strewn out . We may never know . But saying that there is a scientific explanation and only a scientific explanation . Is like saying that since there is life on earth that it came from a meteor ( i &apos;m not sure this is a good analogy but i couldn &apos;t think of a better one ) . We know so little about the world around us that it is stupid to say that on the little information we have that there is definite proof that god doesn &apos;t exist
I would recommend a controversial book titled , PREPARE FOR WAR , by Rebecca Brown MD . I believe she effectively proves the existence of evil and consequently the existence of Gd . While atheism is not of itself a sin leadng to death it is a porthole to evil and a wise person would not go there ! Here is a review of her book : This book is a sequel to the much talked about book , HE CAME TO SET THE CAPTIVES FREE , by physician Rebecca Brown . Some would call her a extreme right wing religious fanatic others downright crazy but those who have encountered the rituals and practices of satanists and those who have experienced demonic and satanic activity within the witchcraft or satanic underground would beg to differ with those evaluations . Many more people than you would think have dabbled and even practiced witchcraft and even lesser evils , be it for pleasure or for serious worship and have found this underworld to be wicked and criminal in more ways than one and have little resource as to how to get out of such a mind-controling anti-religious group / groups and Dr. Brown attempts to show people what that world does to innocent victims and how it operates and how unknowing youth are falling into its spiritual warfare and are finding it to be a battle they dont know how to win or even begin to fight against . Dr. Brown shows those individuals that they can leave satan worship and they can only do that by the blood of Jesus and the grace of Gd . She effectively educates the reader on how to avoid these pitfalls and how to pull oneself out of the mire of them and back onto solid and peaceful ground once again . I give this book at 3.5 for her sincerity and conviction to help those caught in the pits of hell on earth . Some will laugh at her efforts , some will scoff at her remarks , but I guarantee you that anyone who has experienced even one of the portals to hell that she exposes will not only understand her but appreciate her willingness to endure ridicule inorder to SET THE CAPTIVES FREE and do that by teaching them to PREPARE FOR WAR. end quoteIm pretty sure that should annoy some atheists while I dont know why , they dont believe in Gd so they cant believe in satan , they dont believe in heaven so therefore according to them there is no hell , according to them they have nothing to worry about then ! But for those who have seen or experienced satan and his demons , whether in black masses or in dabbling with witchcraft , those people prove beyond a shadow of doubt that Gd exists .... and there is a way out of the curse of satanism and that way out is JESUS CHRIST !
Those observations are not then incompatible with each other , but God &apos;s putative properties exhibit incompatibility such that we ignostics declare Him vacuous . Thus arguments for Him start off without substance and they further exhibit no substance for Him. jdfrieze , gee whiz .
1- This arguement tries to disprove God within the framework of the &quot; omni &quot; God . But it fails because it fails to adopt the utmost argument- that we are not all-understanding . Because of that our logic is inherently lesser , and can fail.2- On the whole issue of God &apos;s omniscience disproving his omnipotence-This completely depends on which view of God you are talking about . Every person and religion define omniscience differently . And again , when you argue under this framework you have to acknowledge the paradigm that we can &apos;t understand everything .
The fundamental failure of this argument is that it is not an argument at all . The theist can accept that there are natural laws by which God functions that transcend him without being self-contradictory ; it all depends on your definition . Atheism cannot be proved until every view of God is disproved , whereas the theist only has to disprove only one atheistic view- that no higher power exists .
Yes , that is a correct observation . But it is merely an observation . For example- everyone has dreams . My dreams are completely different than anyone elses , and the way I dream is completely different . I may think that my dreams are another portion of reality , you may disagree . Does all of this disprove the existence of dreams ? One person may never in their entire life dream ... does this mean that no one dreams ? The truth to this entire debate is that every argument can be answered logically and infinitely , and therefore no logical decision can ever be made . It all has to come down to faith . Either faith in atheism , or faith in theism . That is the key to decision . But how does one acquire that faith ? The only way to acquire faith in either direction is either to close your mind and convince yourself , or open your mind , and ask . ( this is presupposing the assumption that if God exists , he is a personal God . ) If God is there , he will answer . If he isn &apos;t , he won &apos;t . It &apos;s the only way .
I am a scientist and someone who believes in God . Maybe not the way the Bible describes him , as it was written by man and therefore flawed , but I still believe that there is a higher being . We don &apos;t have the scientific methods to test for him ( or her = ) !
Totally agree . This happens WAY too much and I think that there is a way that someday will allow the two to go hand in hand . Plus , as a Catholic , I DO believe in God
see my reply on the op side ................................................................................... : )
I believe in God .. as we can simply see today it was to simple to say you don &apos;t believe in God because of the matter that you never saw him ! ! ! ! ! yet i am telling you ... how can you ask if there really is God ? it only indicates that deep within you there sis ca triggering factor that you still have faith in the Supreme being
Doing all of those things makes you Hitler-like
I do believe in God I was brought up with it and I &apos;d like to think that there is a chance that something happens to me ... not just in a dark abyss or something .
I &apos;m just going to say yes . Any questions about that ?
Yes because God has pulled me out through the hard times , and is the one and only God who loves unconditionally and is fair . If you want a scientific view He created this Earth and there is no way this Earth could have been created by some accident . A cell with its complicated parts could not have been created by an accident either , but only by God and his perfection .
yes because without hope whats the point in living so why dont all you non belivers do a test shoot yourselves and get back to me on God and the Devil
People that don &apos;t believe in GOD have no structure in their lives.That is the people that is always complianing and being miserable.They have nothing to live for.Just remember the world is temporily .
yes of course.people used to say all this stuff that wasnt true and i would just prove them wrong.it is hard to believe but thats life
Yes please just truly pray and believe you will understand , we would not have talked about him for 2009 years if he weren &apos;t real !
Science is not everything . It &apos;s a good thing that only 1 / 5 of the world population are atheists . People who do not have faith are neglecting a huge prospect in their life . Among them are love and knowledge .
YES ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
an atom in this universe must have been created by someone.So who created it ? it couldnt just have popped out from somewhere.Please visit this linked.It explains the science of the quraan http : / / www.islam-guide.com /
I am allowed to believe in both God and the Big Bang . It just so happens that I believe the creation stories are mythical in their nature . Nobody important ever said &quot; the Bible is 100 % fact , &quot; except for maybe a few Popes throughout the ages .
Reason . Common sense . Scientific insight . Things like this enable me to pick out the pure myths . Then there are stories that I don &apos;t know if they are real or not , but these are typically just historical contexts that I can &apos;t prove wrong or right .
I was under the impression that Bhagavan Vishnu was a god in the religion Hinduism and I guess its been awhile since I last checked so is Hinduism no longer in India ? Second ever read the epic of Gilgamesh ? Utnapishtim ( I definitely don &apos;t remember how to spell his name ) tells Gilgamesh a story of how he obtained eternal life through surviving a flood that killed all men across the earth except for those that had been on the boat which I believe were his family and some animals ... that is a poem from Mesopotamia which I believe held the worlds first civilization , the Sumerians . The Epic of Gilgamesh was written between 2750 BC and 2500 BC ( or BCE which ever you prefer ) . Their is also &quot; The Five Worlds adn Their Suns &quot; mentions the gods punishing the people with a flood and do not tell me that the Aztecs copied off of the Sumerians.I do believe that the points you stated regarding my 2nd paragraph were undebatable . Cheers
Xaeon I thought Vishnu was of Hinduism ? Please explain to me who Vishnu is then .
I really don &apos;t know what you were aiming at here ...
That makes a lot of foolish people in the world billions of foolish people.The point in the blind man analogy was not to explain anything about God it was to show that a blind man cannot see blue and I cannot see God but I believe in God since I was raised to believe that way and that a blind man was raised knowing that the ocean is blue and the sky is blue .
Yes ! we have seen very many miracles in the past and from jesus Christ !
I believe in God , there must be a God of some sort because really , you have to look at other theories . Evolution- if evolution really existed , dont you think you would see half monkies and half man walking around . Or half man half donkey since evolution wouldnt just stop when it reached homosapien . And the big bang theory , really , how does this make sense ?
I think that their is something after death I would like to believe that it is Heaven and that the Lord and God are both waiting for me when I pass
What you said is a little confusing
It &apos;s called the argument for the best of both possible worlds . Either ( a ) , we can have a world with no free will , but at the same time no violence , war , crime , sins , etc . OR ( b ) we can have a world where we have free will to do what we want , which leads to some people whom abuse their free will to do bad . Which would you rather live in ?
I think the real question is , DO YOU REALLY EXIST ? or , do you believe in miracles ? are you a creation of your own imagination ? do you believe in ghosts ? I think therefore I am I think ? what is the meaning of existence ? what is the point ? is this reality only yours and yours alone , everyone else you have drummed up to be a part of your existence ? do you know why we do not know the answers to all domains of reality ? if you knew what is and what is to be , would you still want to be in it ? isn &apos;t the unknown part of the charm of being at all ? the mystery , is still out there .
From Letter revealed May 08There are plenty of people with high IQ &apos;s , but that doesn &apos;t make them right on everything . Remember , they say a Harvard Grad can be distinguished by the ability to &quot; speak eloquently , and at length , on subjects they know absolutely nothing about . &quot; Of course , Einstein was smart enough to not even try something like that . He rejected silly ideas people have come up with about the Bible and accepted what he understood from colleagues in Biology.If Einstein pictured cute little animals on a cute little boat , and Mt . Everest covered by water coming from rain , then yes , that &apos;s a silly story . If he pictured a red colored guy with horns , pitchfork and funny tail , then yes , that &apos;s a silly story . If he thought that the Bible teaches that the world is flat , or that the solar system revolves around the earth , or that the earth is supported by some structure rather than floating in space , then yes , those are silly stories.But that &apos;s not what the Bible says
That is all true . I already knew about Christmas coming from the pagans . Whats wrong with faith . My religion has always had that position .
The Romans persecuted Christians the Romans weren &apos;t Christians or even Catholic yet . Where are you making this stuff up the sixth commandment never said that you could kill Canaanites and Babylonians et . As far as the putting people to death I don &apos;t associate Catholics as Christians . True Christian &apos;s never asked to put people to death . One of the main reasons why pilgrims left England was because of there freedom of religion to not be persecuted by Catholics . If you look up the history of Catholicism about 300 A.D. Constantin fused together pagan and Christianity there you have the whack Catholics . I cut and pasted from Wiki below . Look I know the argument is not about a specific religion like the one I believe in . Yes if you encompass all religions that call themselves Christian than yes your death statement is correct . A lot of cults out there call themselves Christian but they are a wolf in sheep &apos;s clothing just like the Catholics are making up there own rules and laws.Ancient Roman religion encompasses the collection of beliefs and rituals practiced in ancient Rome in the form of cult practices . It is therefore the practical counterpart of Roman mythology . Within the Roman world , religious practice varied enough so that one might speak of Roman religions . The cult practices of Rome extended across Italy with the rise of the Roman Empire . These religions were polytheistic , and as such are sometimes referred to as &quot; pagan &quot; .
Saying that god doesn &apos;t exist because he does not step in and counteract problems that humans have brought on themselves is an unreasonable statement . I &apos;m not saying that the that the people that are dying in Africa deserve to die to to genocide or starvation or anything else . I am saying that since god gave man and women free will the things that befall us are the doings of man . We create starvation and war and poverty . Since god gave us free will humans choose their own path whether it is for the bettering of man or for the worsening . It is not his choices that put people in these situations but our own . Why would he step in and change thing when we have the power to change things for ourselves . We create our own world not god he just gave us the power to do so .
Kinda , I almost guarantee Lawnman understands your debate just fine . He &apos;s pretty bright.I know I understand this debate just fine.but your description does indeed show your hand that you believe in a god . Though attempting to be altruistic in that you say as your example the author of a religion does not himself believe it , the assumption of the reasoning behind an author of religion if there is no god to author it them self ( that people were out of control ) is both unknowable , and quite debatable.There is no way to know if 1. whether people ever stopped acting out of control because of the introduction of a god . 2. whether people would stop acting out of control because of the introduction of a god as opposed to any other method of persuasion.The assumption that even if there were not a god , there must at least be a reason to believe in a god , is a deep deep indoctrination within all but a small small percent of humans on earth.It shows you believe in a god.I submit that laws work just fine in and of themselves . People do not need now , and never have needed a god or hope of eternal life or fear of eternal damnation . That religion is a decoration and another means of power , sometimes good , sometimes bad , but unnecessary either way.You want atheists to argue while accepting a premise that most of us do not accept at all.I not only believe a god is not for the greater good . I don &apos;t believe it ever would be under any circumstance . Not even the circumstance you wrote in the debate description .
What did I say ? Don &apos;t bring religion in . But you did it again . You do have a point though.What you &apos;re getting wrong is what religions are INTERPRETING about God &apos;s word , not what it is.You are basing everything on Christianity and that is why your posts on this topic is kind of worthless . I &apos;m not here to discuss Christianity &apos;s views on God . I &apos;m here to discuss God.who are usually schizos or con-artistsGreat . Really great .
God is omnipotent , omnibenevolent , etc. etc.God has as infinite characteristics but ultimately he loves us all and only wants the best for mankind . ^ Tried to make that as short as possible .
naturally it is of greater good , because god has the supreme power and can help us at any time , and when we believe in god we have to ccept this also .
iamdavidh , You seem like a very open minded guy , so I &apos;d like to buy a book for you . I want to do that since I think you would give it a fair reading and I would like to get your opinion on it since it weighs heavily in my opinion on the existence of god . Anthony Flew held many of the same views you do , if not more . But something changed and I find it very compelling . If you are going to change my mind you need to overcome his argument , I &apos;ve included a link to amazon.com so just say the word and I &apos;ll buy it for you .
You seem to miss the question at hand . The question is not can you or do you have morality , I agree you do and can . I also believe you can come up with all kinds of reasons for it ; which you clearly prove you can . The problem is that all the devices you use do it ; reason , logic , your mind , thought , reflection , moral assessments etc. and the morality , ethics , rules etc you come up with are not characteristics of matter nor are they physical in nature . The Atheistic worldview is purely naturalistic by definition and asserts that matter is all there is . It therefore can &apos;t , by definition , have non-materlistic things in it , like logic , reason , morality , ethics etc . So your use of such things disproves your assertion and confirms mine.So then the grounding question becomes critical . To form a correct view of the world one must have an adequate explanation for the things he finds in it . Otherwise your view will be inadequate and quite possibly incorrect . So I assert that your worldview is woefully inadequate to explain all of reality . And is therefore faulty because it &apos;s scope is to narrow and explanation far to simplistic.I &apos;ve included a link to another book for your consideration . And again You &apos;ll have to adequately over come the arguments that are made in this book to change my mind .
I categorically disagree with the definition of God provided here because while trying to provide a definition that will encompass all religions , it denies multiple beliefs . Many religions believe , as did Plato about his &quot; God of the forms , &quot; that God does not make the laws that rule the universe , but rules by the transcendent laws that are already in place . This being said , a multiplicity of religions believe that God did not create the universe &apos;s matter and energy , and nor does he have the power to do so . Also the argument of providing a definition of God to disprove denies one of the fundamental basics of argumentation- in order to disprove anything , you must disprove it within its own framework . For example , to disprove zuess you cannot make up your own definition . It is the same with God . The ontological argument would therefore assert that God must exist universally , because in order for the atheist to disprove God , they have to first accept the definition- which is that he exists
I &apos;m sorry you have so much disbelief . Obviously you put a lot of energy to justify in your own-self about any faith towards God . I &apos;m just going dispute some of the comments about if the world would be better of if Christians where gone . All I have to say is think of a places in the world where there is no God and you will only see death , poverty and despair . The evolution is a farce . Do you remember the cover of national geographic when they had a ape like skull saying that they have found the missing link . Of course that was found out to be a fraud . Point I &apos;m making is , all you have to do is look around and look at the perfect order of nature the extreme complexity and to not even think that there is a creator designer behind it that it is just a mere coincidence . It &apos;s just stupid to think that all you are is just a piece of walking flesh do to the fact that evolution is the only reason you are here . And that all of nature with it &apos;s perfect order is because . Just look up the number of charities and the number is overwhelmingly Christian based probably the number would be actually more because a lot of them are but are afraid of persecution from Church and State laws.You have denial issues I think deep down you really feel that all of these things are possible but you have chosen to block it out and harden yourself for the truth.You know what makes me laugh is that you have Agnostic historians looking in the bible for references to help them find ancient cities and places . Take Troy for example just to name one out the dozens . They thought it was a myth until they discovered it referenced passages out of the bible to help them . Dude totally have taken the whole 9 / 11 thing to far . Pretty insulting of course I don &apos;t believe those you said . All I was saying is that we have been relatively safe as a nation and my faith believes that yes God does protect us nothing wrong with that . Bad things do happen no matter what trials and tribulations are a part of life.As far as using you storied and other quotes from people and Tibet tribes whatever . I don &apos;t care what they think . I don &apos;t look to others to convince me of what I know and believe I question man when I hear a preacher or someone else taking about their Ideas . All I know is that there is a God and creator of us and everything . It &apos;s my own personal believe . Shame on those missionaries for using a lame story about that which is not true . If they where Mormon that would sound like a BS story from them .
I did that unintentionally cause I didn &apos;t know if it went threw or not when my computer was having problems .
How do you account for educated people who are raised in good environments that commit evil ? Also , I &apos;d like to know why people love to do what they know is wrong .
The only God you disprove with your arguments is the one that you have created within your own mind . In order to disprove any framework of belief , you must adopt that framework and disprove it within itself ; therefore , you cannot define God . Because you have failed to disprove God in every sense of the term , your arguments cannot be valid . For example : you have failed to disprove one of philosophy &apos;s most famous examples of God- Plato &apos;s God of the forms . Plato believed that this God ruled by transcendent laws that existed already , and transcended even God himself . This definition meets your argument , and therefore your argument inherently fails to provide any offense , and disproves nothing .
You would like to believe that but the actual facts of the matter and statistics prove you wrong .
There is a God and he lives in all of us .
Nobody broke the law in Florida that &apos;s why the teachers where exonerated . The teachers who where being prosecuted by a wing nut weren &apos;t even the ones who asked to pray it was a member of a church . Remember this was off school property and the teachers where off school time they were there in support only . And it was in a church . Put aside any religion on this , this was a impediment on the first amendment . You and I have debated many things on this lets just agree to disagree I &apos;m not forcing anything thats not my style and it shouldn &apos;t be anyones style . Talking about just the fact that on a daily basis that we are losing freedoms everyday and that a something like this would have gone as far as it did is ridiculous not to mention the tax dollars spent for the courts .
Words that have no meaning if atheism is true and words that shouldn &apos;t exist if atheism is true ; good , deeper , educated , understanding.kindness , importance , well-being , well , harm , undesirable , attained , personal dignity , reward , practical , scientific , Morality , subjective , opinion , religions , God , proving , opinion , laws , allowed , concepts , books , interpretations , greater good , right , wrong , harmful.If you &apos;re arguing for atheism it sure sounds like you are borrowing language from another worldview to support your view .
As is evidenced by the fact that not many people followed Jesus in His time . He was right about so many things but He wasn &apos;t followed then as He might have been . Most people did doubt Him even though He was right in His teachings .
that the people that seem to blame God for everything are the ones that don &apos;t believe in him ?
Then tell me why we haven &apos;t after thousands of years and what makes you think we every will ? I know of only one thing that has , and that you deny .
LOL ! Who said to tell the truth is the greater good ? You &apos;re assuming that telling the truth always results in the greater good huh ? I bet you can think of 1 billion ways in which a lie can work better.Again , I am not saying God is a lie . I am first trying to state whether or not belief in God for the masses is better than lack of belief ... and then whether that belief should be promoted.You &apos;re now bringing religion into the argument . It &apos;s kind of annoying when people do that when it completely misses the point . But just for the sake of it ... let me destroy it. it has given way to horrible things through fanatismThe key word in this is FANATISM . NOT RELIGION . A fanatic in ANYTHING will always result in extreme actions . Take PETA for example . They are not religious , but they can definately take a lot of shi far.It has also allowed governments to control populations through the use of those beliefs.Governments will always control populations . That is what they do . If it &apos;s not religion they &apos;re using , it will be something else . The GOVERNMENT is RESPONSIBLE for USING RELIGION , NOT RELIGION ITSELF ! It has also fostered artificial divisions between different cultures , eventualy leading to wars.Whether you like it or not , people are ALWAYS GOING TO HAVE DIFFERENCES . These differences are ALWAYS GOING TO BE USED by PEOPLE OF POWER for THEIR OWN OBJECTIVES.Do you get the picture ? Religion should not be taking the blame.I don &apos;t think we need God anymore to know what is good or bad . I think people are capable to figure things out on their own.Well atleast you &apos;ve answered the question . However it &apos;s not really an argument.The point I &apos;ve CONSISTENTLY made is that people are NOT able to figure out things on their own . That is why we have laws and rules . My point is that God is better at this than any human alive .
Your example is hard to answer as I do not know all the ins and outs . BUT if we &apos;re going to take the thou shalt not kill for it then yes , she shouldn &apos;t have an abortion . It may not be the right thing to do , but it is the right thing to do . It &apos;s like that Jehovah who died because she wouldn &apos;t take a blood transfusion.I think the basis of your argument is that God &apos;s word cannot be applied to modern day society and in a way you &apos;re right , because the world is moving so fast these days that every decade shows more change than it used to a few hundred years ago and that half the things today aren &apos;t even mentioned in the past i.e. abortion , cloning etc . However I would say that it &apos;s only people &apos;s mentality that is different to the past . We tend to think we know the answers , or questions and that we &apos;re a lot smarter than we used to be . In some ways we are , and in some ways we &apos;re not , some things are better and some things are worse but I think in MOST aspects these &apos; rules &apos; are still as applicable as the past . Give me a few examples of todays problems which you think cannot be solved through religion and I &apos;ll try and explain as best I can as to how religion can be applied to it .
I agree with this guy 100 % and he &apos;s right with some of the declines in modern society . But he said himself ; we need some rules , just not too many and use practical wisdom to make the right choices . I guess we can apply that to some of the scenarios we have . My bad if I &apos;ve made it seem like everything is black and white ( i guess I might &apos;ve ) but it was only to keep the debates as simple as possible.One thing you &apos;re assuming is that people are smarter now than they used to be . There &apos;s no way of knowing and in many cases this is true , especially when you look at western civilisations , however when you look to the east , we could say they &apos;re just as bright as we are , from the egyptians and greeks , to indians and chinese to aztec and mayan ( very little knowledge on them btw ) . Not only did they have numerous powerful and compelling minds , but they also based their reasoning around God and religion . However religions were completely different in those days compared to the religions these days and so to take my argument one step further it is that belief in non-Abrahimic Gods are for the greater good .
Lol . I think either you completely misunderstood my post or I wrote it very badly . I &apos;m against the abrahimic Gods . The thing about those mass suicidic cults is that the same has been done for aliens , not just God . It &apos;s complete brainwashing that is a relatively new phenomenon that has only affected lets say 2000 people ? Within the last 30 years ? My point is that it is so irrelevant and anomolous with humankind &apos;s history , especially when it comes to religion , it should not hold any strength and if it does , it shows that religion needs to be in place to stop people from doing that ... ( as they did it on scientific reasoning ) Facts are facts , but they can be used subjectively . The thing about saying we need to know about everything before making a decision is impossible and tbh says that as people we can &apos;t make a decision . ANY decision we make , we will never know the impact of it , not only is it because we can &apos;t see into the future that would have been , but also we can &apos;t see everybody it might &apos;ve affected.I personally believe sodomy is wrong . And it &apos;s not science if both parties consent to it . If that is the mentality , then when the time comes IF I WANT , then I SHOULD be able to be part lion , part tiger , and have sexual intercourse with baboons . It means if a girl of 12 consents to a 90 year old , it &apos;s ok . Don &apos;t act like it won &apos;t happen , because slowly everything is becoming legal . Even drugs are becoming legal . There &apos;s no science to everything ... Now I &apos;m not against oral sex ... but anything more than that is imo not right . Religious people to do not do things just to please God , but because they also think it &apos;s the right way of living .
That &apos;s a valid point about the Abrahamic faiths , and again perhaps Confucianism , being comparitively &quot; aggressive . &quot; I &apos;d have to take a closer look at other monotheistic religions in antiquity ( the cults of Mithras and Akhennaton were both big ones ) to make a determination about whether moral absolutism seems to be a facet of monotheism generally or just of Judaism-Christianity-Islam.I am not certain if I am saying that Eastern and other faiths are based more on &quot; philosophy , &quot; just that their ethical structures are not necessarily a black-and-white list of &quot; thou shalt not &quot; s . They are frequently presented more as broad precepts to be applied situationally rather than as hard-as-fast rules about certain proscribed behaviors .
