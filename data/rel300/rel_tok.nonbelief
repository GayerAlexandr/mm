&quot; For life to exist , you must have this metabolic motor . But this metabolic motor can only be produced by life . &quot; ( Dr. Ron Carlson ) &quot; The &apos; complex metabolic motor &apos; is the end result of 3.5 billion years worth of evolution . &quot; It &apos;s the same for DNA . So ... if you believe in Spontaneous Generation aren &apos;t you going against the basic rule of biology ( Biogenesis - life only arises from life . It does not come from nonliving matter ) Or is nitrogen , ammonia , salts , and carbon dioxide living matter ? &quot; Biology dose say that modern life cannot arise from &apos; non-life &apos; however the same is not true of the oldest forms of life which did arise from self replicating protens .
I disagree with you completely . Evolution is fact . The fossils prove that . Darwin proposed the theory of evolution by means of natural selection . Intelligent design is just another theory , a theory of evolution by means of intelligent design ( the proponents accept change has occurred and that natural selection occurs at species level ) , They have failed to provide any evidence whatsoever for ID . What would be proof ? Well , it would have to be a big jump in evolution , perhaps something like a fossil rabbit in Jurassic rocks along with dinosaur fossils , something showing that large and unexpected changes have occurred . One theory doesn &apos;t become true just because your incredulity makes it difficult to accept other theories . The theories you want to favour have to have some ( any ? ? ? ) facts supporting them .
Yes , I do understand evolution perfectly well . I &apos;d be interested to see what you regard as credible research on intelligent design . Wishful thinking is not a substitute for decent research . At least Darwin did make predictions which came true . Lord Kelvin ( who was probably one of the pre-eminent physicists of Darwin &apos;s time ) said that evolution by natural selection was impossible , because the Earth could only be 30 million years old , and there was therefore not enough time . Darwin just said that Lord Kelvin was wrong ; how spectacularly wrong is shown by the current accepted age of the Earth of 4.5 billion years . Lord Kelvin was wrong because he didn &apos;t know about radioactivity ( no one at the time did ) which was was keeping the Earth warmer and throwing off his estimate . I have no doubt that those who don &apos;t accept evolution will be shown to be wrong for the same reason , except it will be because of deliberate ignorance rather than inadvertant . Intelligent design is just a theory . It makes no predictions . I &apos;d be interested what your university training was , and how much actual teaching you have had of evolution or even biology . Evolution is completely compatible with religion . Francis Collins quite happily accepts ( theistic ) evolution , and the Catholic Chuch doesn &apos;t insist that Genesis is literally correct , equating creation with the implantatation of the soul in humans .
I apologise . I thought you were sensible and were going to give me some good references . The Discovery Institute is NOT creditable . I am well aware of the site . Many of the &quot; peer reviewed &quot; material are just books , which are not peer reviewed . I notice that the article that Richard Sternberg sneaked into a niche journal on classification and which was later repudiated as being sub-standard makes the list . Obviously , whatever science education you have had at university hasn &apos;t taught you critical thinking , and I would like to know what courses you have actually had ?
Consider how much of our DNA is shared by chimpanzees ( about 97 % ) . Consider cross-species transfer of viruses , bacteria , etc. whereby humans get malaria , hantavirus , dengue fever and other diseases.That by itself is sufficient to show that &quot; Intelligent Design &quot; is oxymoronic . As one of my Philosophy instructors often stated : &quot; If God created the universe , he was an incompetent engineer . &quot;
Intelligent Design Your comment : More and more respected academics are seeing the immense flaws in the evolution argument. is completely untrue as far as I have seen in 37 years and I live &amp; work with academics ( they are mostly scientists ) ( and I am one ) . During this time I have met one &apos; scientist &apos; ( not an academic ) who supported ID ( tho I think he is now reconsidering ) . Blanket false statements like this establish lack of credibility .
Intelligent Design is simply Creation Science &#91; sic &#93; , relabeled in an attempt to disguise as essentially the Book of Genesis in a feeble-minded attempt to promote Genesis as science . Philip Kitcher , in his book &quot; Abusing Science : The Case Against Creationism , &quot; totally demolished any claim that Cretionism had to being scientific , ipso facto , the same applies to Intelligent Design . Neither of the two put forth any hypotheses that are testable for falsity ( Karl Popper &apos;s Principle of Falsification ) . Any statement that cannot be tested for falsifiability is not scientific . At best , Intelligent Design is a pseudo-science aimed at brainwashing our children into believing absolute hogwash for truth .
Why do you find it easier to believe in a supernatural creator , than creation as a natural process ? If God made the universe , what did he make it out of ? You cannot prove a negative . I can tell you that there is a tea cup in orbit around Alpha Centauri 4.3 light years away , and the ask you to prove me wrong . You cannot . However I would say that it is extremely unlikely.If there is an intelligent designer he was not very bright . Blind spots in eyes , flesh eating bacteria , parasitic wasps , nice fella.Whilst I cannot say &quot; there is no God &quot; I can say that the evidence , at this time , shows it to be extremely unlikely .
The Rabbi is laboring under the mistaken impression that there is a coherent concept of God that would make sense of his / her / its role in creation ; and also seems to think that the universe began at some point in time , even though that is actually a misunderstanding of the Big Bang hypothesis , which most physicists do not believe was an absolute beginning , though it may have occurred as far back as we can look . For all we know , the universe is infinite in time and space . One can define an infinite number of explanations for the world and how it came to be ( assuming again that it did come to be ) . For example , maybe the world was created by a single bunny rabbit . On the other hand , maybe it was created by two bunny rabbits . Or three bunny rabbits ... Since there are an infinite number of possible explanations , one needs to be able to cut the field down to some manageable number of options . God is not one such options at present because the philosophical contexts in which &quot; God &quot; is a valid concept are no longer acceptable . God made sense in terms of Plato or Aristotle &apos;s metaphysics . I doubt if the Rabbi is up to specifying a context which would make sense of the God notion .
How convenient it is that God is so complex that we will never be able to apply rational human logic to fully comprehend him . That &apos;s a completely ridiculous notion ! If we took that approach to science we would still be roaming around in loincloths . Great idea ! Let &apos;s all intelligent thought aside and submit ourselves to God &apos;s almighty plan .
Juanita , How can you find it more likely that a super-being , who was always there , created everything out of nothing , with only one tiny planet in trillions as his only purpose and the rest as space junk . This super being , loves you if you worship him and tortures you forever if you die still asking questions . Though you may feed the poor and help the helpless - you burn if you don &apos;t believe.If you knoew someone like this on earth , they would be either in prison or in a mental hospital.By the way , the only time Jesus ever defined God when cornered by the apostles , he simply said &quot; God is Love &quot; . Love creates , love lasts , love heals . Jesus never believed in a grumpy old man in the sky who fries you if you don &apos;t get on your knees and worship him.I think Jesus would have thrown you out of the temple for your ignorance . Put God to the same test you would your husband or loved ones and see if he doesn &apos;t fail miserably .
&quot; I am a bit disappointed in the human race . The human race as a whole has tried for centuries to X out God and any religious ideas and characteristics . I am rather embarrased of the ignorance of men . Anyways , this has to be the most silly question in history-if you &apos;re educated and have any sense of moral sense you would agree . If the world wasn &apos;t created by the Supreme Being ( GOD ) , than how else would it have gotten here . If any one person ( or organization ) expect me to ever believe that Earth one day just decided to appear in space and isolate the water from land and create it &apos;s own self a moon and set the sun impeccably in it &apos;s place and everything revolve and correlate in it &apos;s proper manner every morning-day-season-year etc &quot; I really do not know where to start . This line &quot; if you &apos;re educated &quot; is later followed by an admittance of a complete lack of knowledge about the formation of Earth and the moon . I mean seriously , you could TiVo National Geographic for a week and have a basic understanding of all the &quot; scientific mysteries &quot; you mentioned . You call people who disagree ignorant when it is you who choose to subjectively ignore information and evidence . Information and evidence observed by man , not created by him.Riddle me this . It &apos;s is a known fact that the distance between the Earth and moon is increasing by 3.8 meters a century . Eventually it will leave Earths orbit but the effects will be felt long before that . If our solar system was created by God why would he put an expiration date on it ? Our Sun isn &apos;t going to last forever either mind you.Another thing that has always bothered me is why is there so much else out there ? Why would a God create so much noise in the universe when we are his main concern ? In the old ideas the Earth was the center . If everything did revolve around us and we were the center of the universe ( as was the idea when religions formed ) then a Creator would seem like the obvious answer .
Yes it is true that we were not there . But there is always something there , such as geographical evidence . No one has tried to say that they saw how the world was created . No , instead they try to prove through factual evidence that it was created . To go off a book that was created billions of years after the world created with no factual evidence besides people seeing / hearing some divine figure is rediculous
&quot; God on the other hand , is an immaterial being who is comprised of no parts . As such , He is irreducibly simple , and thus does not require a cause . &quot; You might as well be saying &quot; There is no god . &quot;
There are many other scientific reasons why the universe was created
The rabbi writes : &quot; they cannot explain without significant problems on the one hand , or an articulation that resembles one of Divinity without the label on the other hand , what existed prior to the world . The existence of a God , without beginning and without end , spatially or temporally , solves this problem . &quot; It DOES NOT solve the problem at all . How did a god , without beginning and without end , come to be ? No one knows for sure how the universe started , but one thing that is for sure is that there is not one scrap of evidence for the existence of a supernatural being . Not one ! ! There is ample evidence for the non-existence of any god , because where has he , she , or it shown him- , her- or itself ? Nowhere . We only have probably fictional accounts in the so-called holy books , which are full of inaccuracies and falsehoods . For example , the Bible says that the world is flat and the sun revolves around it . This is patently false . Therefore , we cannot believe anything in the Bible or the Koran for sure . So there have been no uncontested proofs of any miracles . So no evidence for anything supernatural existing.Leon Marzillier
Then there is the principle of first cause . What created the creator . If one insists that the creator satisfies the Principle of Sufficient Reason to satisfy the argument , then I would apply the Principle of Parsimony and state that a creator is not an ontologically necessary entity . That the universe could have created itself at the moment that space-time started . Time is meaningless before the beginning of space-time .
I think we can see this by looking at previous questions which were answered by appealing to the supernatural . In response to the three components : 1 ) Theories of , or beliefs in , a Divine source constitute the longest standing range of explanations for phenomena like weather , disasters , and other events that have natural explanations . Looking historically it is almost certain that far , far , more people have used divinities to explain things like lightning than have used the modern scientific explanation . Even today , it is possible to find people around the world who hold similar beliefs . The mere fact that a certain kind of explanation has been popular doesn &apos;t mean that that class of explanations are good or true.2 ) A similar point goes for # 2 . I do not see how he could possibly believe point # 2 to be relevant . Theories and beliefs of a divine source for the human species likely constitute the most agreed-upon range of explanations believed by human beings , both historically and today . Regardless of what the good Rabbi &apos;s view on evolution is , he surely doesn &apos;t think that the question of whether evolution is true or not can be solved by polling people . It doesn &apos;t make any sense to try to determine if evolution is true by counting the number of people who believe it or don &apos;t believe it . Why then , would theories about the origin of the universe be any different ? 3 ) Even if current ( naturalistic ) theories about the source of the universe suffer problems , this is no reason to assume that a divinity must be the answer . As I stated in # 1 , previously unexplainable phenomena were also explained using supernatural beings . The fact that at various points in history humans didn &apos;t have a natural explanation didn &apos;t make a supernatural explanation the correct answer . I also am curious as to how exactly God is supposed to solve the problem of existence . It only seems to raise the question of why God exists . If we assume that God simply always existed , why can &apos;t we assume that the material universe always existed ( albeit likely in a rather different form prior to the big bang ) ? In other words , if existence requires explanation , then God &apos;s existence also requires an explanation and simply saying that God always existed answers nothing ; if existence doesn &apos;t require explanation , then there is no need to appeal to God as an explanatory force at all .
Unless I &apos;ve missed something , you &apos;ve started out by saying that because humans have believed in gods for a very long time , it must be true.Does it not matter that we &apos;ve also believed in a very long list of things ( ghosts , world being flat , monsters , etc ) that have been proven wrong ? And don &apos;t you think it a bit odd that , if popular belief in a god lends some credibility to the idea of a god , there &apos;d have been an agreed upon god as opposed to everyone disagreeing on how many gods , who , and what there are ? How about , instead of using popular opinion as an argument , you actually argue the case for the existence of a god ?
No , really.But also , Einstein was really not keen on being cast as a believer in a personal god . He publicly ridiculed the notion and those that took his quotes out of context . So in a way , Rabbi , you should consider yourself chastised by the SMARTEST MAN EVER ! Anyway , regarding the question . Have you checked out physics in the last century or so ? I hate to be overly sarcastic , but I think the most qualified answer to you question is in that field of study ; look under &quot; big bang &quot; , maybe.So , this is a terrible arguement for the existence of god . First , the idea that the univers HAD TO HAVE a creator can , must be applied to God , if the question is relevant at all.Perhaps the world come from us , in the future , when we send the catalyst for the cosmos back into the past to start the big bang . I see no reason why this is less likely than any theistic explanation .
If an anthropomorphic god created the world who created god ? God was created by psychopaths to help them rule over other men . Take Moses , he killed at least one man , had two wives , told his people there was a promised land they had to get by killing other people and stealing it from them , he took all the people &apos;s gold from them so only he could use gold as an idol . George Bush used god to justify attacking a dictator the CIA helped install and murder somewhere between 60 some thousand and 1.5 million Iraqi civilians , yet he had the audacity to murder prisoners who were accused of murder and later found innocent . God never changes , it is always a schizophrenic tool used by psychopathic ego driven greedy shameless humans .
All our children each have 50 % of our genes ( and that is not blue genes for you morons ) .Add to that that they grow up initially in our environment.And voila ! We can see al lot of ourselves ( and our spouses ) in our children.Stop wasting your time studying bibles and other &quot; so called &quot; holy books.The truth is in biology , not religion .
I &apos;m afraid &quot; conventional wisdom &quot; isn &apos;t a very firm basis on which to rest an argument . &quot; Conventional wisdom &quot; has held a lot of things which turned out to be wrong . Moreover , it is not clear that the conventional wisdom cited here is in fact universal to the human species ( and even if it were , so what ? Humankind can &apos;t be wrong ? ) . I would suspect that this is a cultural , not a species , assumption . An idea , for example , which had been dominant in the West was that of the great chain of being , where all things were connected in this chain , and related things looked like one another . Thus , in the Renaissance walnuts were thought to be good for treating problems with the brain because they resembled human brains . An even bigger objection is that the claim that things tend to &quot; reflect &quot; their source seems to be inaccurate . It is also a vague phrase that can probably be shifted in ways that make it impossible to disprove , but let &apos;s leave that aside . The examples given here really stack the deck . For any one exmaple of how a thing looks like its source , I could likely give 10 examples of things that do not . Knowledge looks nothing like the books from which it was obtained ; books look nothing like trees ; trees look nothing like acorns ; acorns , in turn , look nothing like trees , nor like sunlight , water , or nutrients . I shouldn &apos;t have to belabor the obvious here - claiming that things resemble their sources is such a vague claim that it is largely meaningless , and if the claim is made more specific , it becomes less apparent that this is something we should assume , &quot; conventional wisdom &quot; or not . Without this very problematic assumption , there is no argument . The American atheists must really be slacking off if they haven &apos;t registered an objection to this &quot; argument &quot; yet .
The literal interpretation of the Bible &amp; Torah as well as your own argument ( apparently ) suggest that a God exists with all of the physical features of a human man , though it &apos;s never been explained why exactly a god would require genitals , waste disposal , legs , or anything , really . Children look like their parents not because their parents chose to make them that way but because they passed on a set of their own genes . Children sometimes act like their parents because they were exposed to a certain mindset , environment and ideology . Why , then , would the God of the Bible choose to expose us and command of us violence , hate , racism , sexism , but not even bother to suggest compassion in , say , his Ten Commandments ? Why would he share with us only a few attributes but not all , if we are truly made in his image ? It seems , as usual , the theist conclusion has come not from evidence and logical reasoning first , then conclusion , but conclusion first than a half-hearted attempt at evidence and logical reasoning to convince others of the conclusion .
&quot; the burden of disproof of the theory of the existence of God is placed squarely upon my opposition in this debate . &quot; Absolutely ridiculous . How about some more quotes ? &quot; Every claim requires evidence , and extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence &quot; .Science does not busy itself with disproving * anything * . There &apos;s no point in disproving what does not exist . Rather , the burden is on Christian &apos;s to provide evidence for their extraordinary claims . Science is simple , and you seem to have the whole process backwards.The burden of proof is on those who make the claim , not on those who remain skeptical of outrageous claims.The null position is atheism . We are ALL atheists when we are born . We are then taught a religion . The null position is atheism and any deviance from null requires evidence , oh which you have none .
&quot; I would rather point out that your inability to prove the origin of life , the origin or very nature of the universe , &quot; A hundred years ago we couldn &apos;t prove what lightning was . We couldn &apos;t prove what the sun was . We couldn &apos;t prove what stars were . We couldn &apos;t prove anything regarding atoms , molecular theory , or most of the modern principles of biology and physics.And people , religious people , simply claimed they were God acting in his way . Further back , when it was offered that the world was round and the sun was the center of our galaxy , not the earth , the church killed people over those views . Further back , the Egyptians attributed the sun , the moon and their harvest to religion . Happy gods brought good harvests . Angry gods brought plagues . No science , and religion filled the holes.Religion has always said &quot; Science can &apos;t prove it , therefore it must be god &quot; . And , given enough time , science has always found evidence .
&quot; But I call that biased science . You don &apos;t really think we know it all , do you ? &quot; Of course not . I believe we know very , very , little . I believe our pathetic mammalian brains give us the power to think we &apos;re special , the power to create little gods for us to worship , but fail to give us any semblance of the ability to fathom the truths of this universe . &quot; Why would you assume that a simple understanding of some of the forces of nature disproves God &apos;s existance ? &quot; Again , you are looking at it all wrong . I don &apos;t want to disprove your sky wizard . We &apos;ve created thousands of your yahwehs . Thors . Odins . Amen-Rah &apos;s and Imoteps . Literally thousands . Keep your little dude in the sky . In fifty years they &apos;ll be fifty more of them . I don &apos;t have the time or desire to disprove every single god that every single culture decided to make.Instead , I realize quite easily that we &apos;re all born atheist , and we &apos;re taught religion by our family / society . I realize there is no proof for religion . I realize that religion exists outside of the realm of proof . It cannot be proved or disproved.I realize it is a statistical possibility for a god , whether it be your precious Judeo-Christian god , or Odin , to exist . But I realize that in the case of your god , if he would send me to hell simply because I do not &apos; believe &apos; in him , than I would never want to worship so petty and vain a creature .
The absence of proof does not prove absence . The absence of proof does not prove presence , either . The absence of proof does not provide reason to consider God even possible . After 10,000 years of belief. there is not even a decent collection of evidence , let alone proof , one must conclude that such an entity is misconceived . The pervasive Judeo-Christian-islamic God should have been clearly proven long ago.Is there something &quot; bigger &quot; than us , something which is everywhere at the same time , something which contains all the knowledge there is ? Nature , which we do perceive , certainly qualifies . Conceiving of God as a conscious being is a wrong way of conceiving of answers to the questions above . That &apos;s why there &apos;s such a long-standing absence of proof.So , we can validly say , There is no such thing as God , as described by those who claim to think so .
Human being just want strong reason for everything . Why I stumbled over that rock ? Bad karma , God punished you ( or you were too inattentive ) .Why You got sick ? You did not wash your hands day before.Why it rains today ? Cyclons and atmosphere levels did that.Why Universe expands ? Big bang happend very long time ago.Why this particle appears in so many places at once ? Erm .. wait , we still sorting it out.Yes indeed , we do search for meaning all the time . But in most cases it is not needed for everyday life . You &apos;ll find meaning eventually when You &apos;ll be very passionate about something and / or when you will have strong relationships with someone ( friends , family , even with your cat or dog ) . They say that death brings meaning of life . Not realy . Death might play some role in valuation . But meaning comes from passions and desires not from cheating death ( unless it is not your very special passion ) .
I have been told that there is a bull elephant in this phone booth , and though I have searched high and low , I haven &apos;t found him yet . That doesn &apos;t mean I won &apos;t though ...
The absence of proof is not proof of absence , but I must admit at the end of the day , I have no reason to believe that god exists . So as Richard Dawkins points out in his book , The God Delusion , we should be as skeptical of God &apos;s existence as we are of the existence of a teapot that orbits the earth and can &apos;t be be observed by any of our human senses . So , we can &apos;t say with certainty that God or the teapot doesn &apos;t exist but there is still a lack of evidence as a whole for God &apos;s existence . &quot; Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof . &quot; -- Carl Sagan Adam Lane , vice president , Ohio University Skeptic &apos;s Society http : / / www.facebook.com / home.php ? ref = logo # / group.php ? gid = 64100880412
Millions of people over a period of thousands of years have looked for evidence of the existence of a god . Nobody has ever found one object which could be shown to anyone else to demonstrate that such a god exists . In this case , the overwhelming absence of evidence is proof enough to any reasonable person that there are no gods .
Rabbi , I am not sure whether you &apos;re aware of the purpose of debate . Let me clue you in : to present arguments which make a case for your side . Aside from your rather strange attempt at claiming that popular belief in some kind of god gives the idea credibility , I &apos;ve seen no such attempt by you . Most theists at least try to come up with a logical argument to make their pre-existing beliefs seem viable , but you seem to have given up before you &apos;ve even started ! Instead , you &apos;ve apparently come to the debate with the arrogant conclusion that you don &apos;t need to make any serious attempt at rationalizing belief in god . Why ? Your claims about faith seem a little odd as well , less of an argument and more of an excuse . Why , if you are so willing to believe and base your life off of faith in a god without any evidence , why not believe in anything without evidence ? Don &apos;t believe in the Flying Spaghetti Monster ? Why not ? Where is the difference ? I &apos;m almost ashamed the atheist side ( which , by the way , atheists generally do not believe there is no god , but instead simply have a lack of belief--shame on the way this debate was set up , as well ) didn &apos;t have a remotely serious opponent .
OK , as a guy that spent many years wishing I could believe in god , the Cost / Benefit argument has to be one of the least inspiring reasons someone might believe in such a thing.Is god such a tool that any schlep with a calculator in one and and crossed fingers in the other gets saved ? And is the point spread the Rabbi refers to on &quot; faith &quot; in no god ( mischaracterizing skepticism anyway ) supposed to scare the nonbeliever ? We already we live in an inherently meaningless universe alone on a mote of dust with steadily declining viability for the future ! What do we care what the odds are things might be different when we die ? This whole argument revolves around the definition of belief itself , which typically fails to acknowledge if one chooses what to believe and then organizes the facts of life , or if one is lead to beliefs based on the facts of life.The last defense of theism typically resorts to the logical problem of proving something does not exist or highly covoluted discussions about how free-will and determinism are actually coexistant and how morally bankrupt the world would be without the relentless pandering , sycophancy , coercion , bribery , and extortion behind most faith and arguments therefor ... So just get there already if this is the best you got .
You compare God to Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy . Do you think they might exist , too ? Somehow I doubt it.You &apos;re right that not having experienced something does not prove that the thing doesn &apos;t exist . However , it means there had better be a pretty good reason for assuming that it does . If I told you that the air around us was full of tiny invisible fairies that are undetectable in any way , would you say , &quot; Yeah , maybe &quot; ? I hope you &apos;d say , &quot; Get real , that doesn &apos;t make any sense . &quot; But my positing of invisible fairies is just as arbitrary as positing the existence of God , or Santa Claus , or the Tooth Fairy . It might make me happy to believe in the fairies . I might even have some complex belief system about them that causes me to be a nicer person . That doesn &apos;t make the fairies real.Whether or not there is a God is just as much an issue as whether or not there are invisible fairies around us all the time . If there &apos;s no good reason to think something exists , we should default to &quot; no , &quot; at least for the time being . I don &apos;t claim to have proof that there is no God . I just think it &apos;s an arbitrary concept to make up , and I think the burden of proof lies with the person making the outlandish claim .
Why does it have to be so simple ? Because you want it to be ... I think lots of religious people are like that , they want a quick , succinct , all-encompassing answer to where we came from , what are we doing here , and what happens to us after we die . Sorry things can &apos;t be explained so easily for you . Try opening a science book and actually learning about what few things we have managed to understand about the universe . I &apos;m sure it &apos;s just scratching the surface .
Welcome the liberating world of the agnostics . Come on in , the water &apos;s fine.Then mental gymnastics required to justify faith in a god and defend him / her are simply not worth it . To argue the unknown without working toward substantive proof is folly . For every question the non-believer has , the believer always answers with the mystic . Surely this will not be popular , but in my opinion , if there really is a god , you can keep him . He / she is either cruel , incompetent , or both . Defending his / her positions only makes a person look foolish .
You are the one who is anthropomorphizing the Unified Field theories ... I just pointed out that the OT , NT , and the totality of Christian theology do not agree with your statements .
If we are talking about personal , superpowered God then it &apos;s not hard to tell without doubts - such God ( s ) does not exist . ( Just like does not exist Earth in center of the Universe and everything else orbits around it . ) And any atheist will stick to this statement until science prove otherwise .
It is how you look at it . Science can deal with creator in psyholigical sense . Why we ( humans ) created creator ( deities ) in the first place . Also any school of philosophy takes chances on idea of creator as such.However science may tell you some day in the future why there was big bang and what caused it . Like science told us that lighting is not an act of God and Earth is not the center of Universe . Scary thing to do is to do nothing in fields of science and teach our childrens scary stories about gnomes and so on.Even if we are in some kind of box and Creator is out of it - then he also can &apos;t interact with us . But anything what gets into the box can be in some way or another observed by us and by our scientists as well . It &apos;s simple .
Yes , but the null position should still be the atheist position , not the agnostic position . Fantastic claims , whether the Flying Spaghetti Monster ( blessed be His name , amen ) or a God , who created the Universe , exist , require fantastic evidence . Particularly when you claim that God created a Universe 14.5 billion years ago , to be at least 26 billion light years across 13 billion years ago ( because the furthest galaxy we can see now is 13 billion light years away , and the light from there has therefore taken 13 billion years to get here ) , with about 10,000 billion billion stars , just for the benefit of humans on a tiny speck of rock orbiting a totally insignificant star . And yet this God is still around , listening to the prayers of his believers , and occasionally granting but usually ignoring them , without ever actually giving any proof of his existence . I expect that when I press the submit button , if there is a God , I will be instantly electrocuted for blasphemy .
Is it not also quite a stretch to assert that something of that nature DOES exist ? Any concept could be concocted and then defended on the basis of insufficient evidence to the contrary , but without evidence backing said concoction ( save for gaps in human understanding ) , what &apos;s to say that it &apos;s valid or even worth considering ?
I never doubt that there is no tooth fairy.I never doubt that there is ground beneath my feet.Similarly , I never doubt that this hugely imaginative &quot; god &quot; thing is an outright fabrication.Doubt doesn &apos;t happen in situations where the right answer is so blindingly obvious that the only way around the truth is imaginative fabrication .
You are seriously misinformed about the nature of scientific knowledge.Yes , our understanding of physics is constantly being refined . However , there are some basic concepts that have been confirmed over and over again and are not in doubt . Yes , occasionally we find a special case in which an old rule seems not to apply , but that leads us to the discovery of new , broader rules , which can be simplified in each special case to the old ones . We have wholly rejected some very old theories , most of which were formulated before the idea of the scientific method was popular . ( As a &quot; scientist &quot; Aristotle claimed that objects fall because they want to , and that projectiles move forward because that is in their nature . ) However , by and large we are building upon old knowledge rather than scrapping it entirely.One of the concepts which we come to , time and time again , in all different areas of physics , is the concept of symmetry and conservation . There are several fundamental quantities ( or related pairs quantities , like energy and mass , or space and time ) that follow invariance rules . Conservation of mass and energy is a very basic , foundational principle , and one which is not at all in doubt among scientists .
I consider myself an atheist , for I see no need for a god to have created the universe or have any role in the playing out of events in this existence . However this does not automatically mean that god does not exist . Yet if a god does exist , I do not believe it would be at all the sort of god which any of today &apos;s religions adhere to . It would not care about humans anymore than the air around us , for we are all simply made of matter , energy , and void which interacts according to strict rules which we have never seen broken . Why would the creator of EVERYTHING care about one small bit of its creation which is in no way different than any other bit except in its own heavily biased opinion . The universe may just be some pan-dimensional teenager &apos;s science-fair experiment simulation on his computer which they created to study the formation of galaxies . Humans and other life are just things which happened to develop due to this set up of the laws of physics .
I to have always had strong beliefs about god and the universe and have as well made my decision about religion and I do not believe in a god . But if matter can not be created nor destroyed , where did it all start out at ? The BIg Boom theory states that the universe was like a balloon which under compression finally exploded causing a chemical reaction beginning life in our universe and our universe itself . But something can not come from nothing . How did the first universe come to be ? My argument has always been &quot; we are still discovering this answer &quot; but i have yet to see scientists evaluate this answer any further than I myself have . Any words of comfort ?
If he &quot; always was , and always will be &quot; as so many profess , why can &apos;t we say the same thing about the universe ( s ) ?
Does the ball gain mass ? It is gaining energy ( potential ) Photons have ( are ) energy , if energy has mass then why don &apos;t photons have mass ?
If you do not understand the Science then why do you keep making unsupported Scientific arguments ?
Einstein &apos;s statement reflects his view that the universe could be explained in an experimentally deterministic way . He spent his last years in life trying to come up with a unified theory of physics because to him the notion of quantum uncertainty was so unsettling . The next great discovery in physics will likely a unified theory ( after we find the Higgs boson of course ) . Regardless , Einstein &apos;s view has more to do with a certain view of nature rather than the existence of a god that shapes all things with some omnipotent guiding hand .
I &apos;m an atheist - always have been , always will be . Most people don &apos;t change sides once they &apos;ve come to a decision . So my comment is really about the nature of the argument . I &apos;m weary of believers saying that evolution isn &apos;t true , or that they see god when they look at children . Even if there were merit to any of it , it &apos;s no basis for the existence of god . Nor is evolution &apos;s truth a basis for the absense of God . Can &apos;t we dispense with this silliness ? Neither side can win the argument , because neither can answer the first and foremost question of being : Why is there something instead of nothing ? I believe in the Big Bang Theory , but even that doesn &apos;t answer the question . My biggest argument against god so far is that religious people came up with him - the same people who have been denying scientific progress for hundreds of years . But both science and religion come from a human need to seek order and truth . So far science has won the battle but not the war .
Really , the wager isn &apos;t a 50 / 50 bet . What if you pick the wrong god , and the true god is a jealous spiteful one , and you have to face Zeus , for example , in the afterlife ? Might you be better off not believing in any god , rather than insulting god by believing in someone else ? It would be good if you could actually prove your god &apos;s existence , instead of relying on blind faith . Or better still , if he could give a sign that no one would be able to dismiss .
You asked a couple of good questions . Let &apos;s see if I can give you some good answers . First , regarding conviction and belief . You wrote : &quot; Right now I sit in a chair , convinced it will hold me up . I &apos;ve never studied a chair I don &apos;t know exactly why or how long chairs will hold people up , but I believe that I am safe . So I think that conviction and belief are closer and strongly related than you might suppose . &quot; It &apos;s quite okay to say that you &quot; believe &quot; a chair will hold you up . Most of our convictions are subconscious evaluations formed many years ago and they &apos;ve become automatized . We &apos;ve had countless experiences since childhood that when we can sit in a chair it will hold us up . From those experiences we &apos;ve formed evaluations which in time have become firm convictions . It &apos;s okay to use the term &quot; believe &quot; in this manner . It &apos;s not precise , but most people know what you mean . In everyday talk , we often use the two concepts interchangeably . However , in serious discussions I like to be more precise simply because to do so usually results in easier and quicker mutual understanding.But the two concepts are very different , for the reason I previously stated . In a serious discussion we make ourselves almost instantly understandable by your saying , for example , you believe in God and for me to say I am convinced God does not exist . The bonus in this is that we both see we have different viewpoints---or as is said these days , &quot; we know where the other is coming from . &quot; Were each of us to use the same term , confusion would immediately result . And it would take us several hours , maybe days , to sort out what each mean . Your reference to bungee jumping is pretty much the same idea but using a different example . Many people go through their entire lives wishing things were so , or believing something is safe . That does not alter the nature of the intellectual methodology of belief and its distinct difference from conviction . The other question you asked was : &quot; What would you define as true happiness ? &quot; Novelist / philosopher Ayn Rand wrote : &quot; Happiness is the successful state of life , pain is an agent of death . Happiness is that state of consciousness which proceeds from the achievement of one &apos;s values . &quot; This must be understood in the context of her philosophy , Objectivism . Miss Rand is referring to values that are in accordance with man &apos;s rational nature , fundamental values such as reason , purpose and self-esteem from which other values such as the choice of one &apos;s career , the type of art one enjoys , the qualities of character one esteems in others , and so forth . She is NOT referring to those who claim a &quot; value &quot; in taking mind-destroying drugs , or sexual promiscuity or hedonism . If one holds values in accordance with man &apos;s rational nature and seeks to achieve them , when one does so , one certainly experiences a state of happiness . For example , say you want very much to find a life-partner . You think about what you want in a partner . You don &apos;t sit at home and mope . You go out and look around and meet different people and find what you want or something very close to it and you become friends with that person . Surely you &apos;ve achieved a value . And surely that achievement will make you happy . I mentioned that achieving happiness begins with rejecting a religious moral code . You wrote : &quot; For my religion ( Christianity ) that would mean rejecting love , obedience to authority , unselfishness , etc . Good things in my opinion , and yours too I would think . &quot; I think love is very good . I also think that love is not possible for those who believe in God . I think that those who value love as you say you do , do so on my code of values , not on the Christian code of values . I think &quot; obedience to authority and unselfishness &quot; are very bad things . I think both are mind-destroying and spiritual suicide . Many Americans have a mixed set of values . One set of values is based on a rational code of morality that they &apos;ve never discovered . Another set of their values are based on Christianity , which continuously erodes their rational code of morality . Ayn Rand has identified the rational code of morality . It is a code of morality based on man &apos;s nature as a basically good and valuable entity , with a rational faculty that can be his most glorious asset , if he chooses to use it.I cannot promise you to read Mere Christianity . I &apos;ve read many books on Christianity and the other religions of the world.I &apos;m delighted to hear that you will read Ayn Rand &apos;s novels , particularly Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead .
Then it stands to reason : is it useful to believe in god without a religious basis ? Without evidence , the answer is no .
Evolution is fact ( the fossils show change ) . Darwin proposed the theory of evolution by means of natural selection . Intelligent design is just another theory ; a theory of evolution by means of intelligent design ( the proponents don &apos;t deny change , nor do they deny natural selection at species level ) . The proponents of ID have failed to provide any evidence or ways of recognising ID when or if it occurs , and until they do so , it can &apos;t be taken seriously . Natural selection , on the other hand , has a lot of evidence in its favour .
Granted that science never &apos; proves &apos; theories , it merely rejects theories which have been falsified , but that &apos;s kind of a minor clarification.You have to admit that the above comment ( while poorly constructed ) does have a point insofar as the existence of an omnipotent being would mean that the so-called immutable laws of physics would be more like traditions of physics given that they could be &apos; over-ruled &apos; at will . If the object of science is to whittle away false theories in order to leave behind the theories which can &apos;t be falsified , then the existence of an omniscient being would defeat that purpose ( since it could falsify any theory ) .
You do have to admit , though that if God existed , he would undermine the assumptions of science : namely that there are natural laws which we can try to approximate . God &apos;s existence would preclude the possibility of immutable natural law .
Aren &apos;t you creating trouble for yourself , inupiaqswagger ? If &quot; Joshua &quot; is correct , then the other books of the Old Testament are also correct , and the Earth is 6,000 years old . The way scientists would date soil is by the age of organic matter in it by means of carbon-14 dating , and for this dating to correspond with the biblical chronology it would have to be reliable . Which would mean that other dates given by C14 dating would also be correct including the ones of 40,000 years ( which is at least 6 times the biblical age of the Earth ) . I don &apos;t know how reliable the science is ( I did a Google search , and the only links were back to your comment ) . I &apos;d be interested if you could provide a link to the report.Hezekiah &apos;s tunnel was rediscovered in 1838 . So there wouldn &apos;t have been many scientists ( not even Darwin ) who would have been able to use its non-existence as evidence of the falsity of the bible . It would hardly be surprising that Jerusalem would have had a secure source of water , in case of a siege , and the bible mentioning a real structure hardly makes the rest of the book correct ( you might as well argue that since &quot; Harry Potter &quot; mentions King &apos;s Cross Station , then the books must be true , because the station also exists ; come to think of it , I have been to King &apos;s Cross and seen a wall between platforms 9 and 10 marked platform 9 3 / 4 , with a trolley embedded in the wall-so they must be true ! ) .
Yes , natural selection is a ( scientific ) theory about a mechanism of evolution ( a fact ) , for which there is overwhelming evidence , and intelligent design is just an invented explanation , for which there is no evidence . Don &apos;t waste my time by ( poorly ) quoting the bible as evidence . First of all you &apos;d need to prove that god exists and that the bible is more than a poorly edited collection of inconsistent works of fiction . Once you have done that , then you can come back and we can discuss whether god works through evolution or whether god is a deceiver ( as Philip Henry Gosse in his book &quot; Omphalos &quot; published in 1857 2 years before the Origin seemed to believe ) and created an earth 6000 years old to look 4.5 billion years old . The bible is wildly inaccurate with regard to science , besides stating that pi equals exactly 3 , and that the earth &apos;s rotation can be just stopped for a day so Joshua can just commit another of his acts of divine sanctioned genocide . I won &apos;t even try to correct your use of the word &quot; accident &quot; ; it &apos;s obvious you don &apos;t have the slightest understanding of evolution .
Yet Behe &apos;s irreducible complexity has never been demonstrated and has no significant support in the Scientific community . Robin Collins fine tuning is a philosophical argument , not a Scientific one.Science may not have all the answers , but so far it has done a much better job of describing the world around us then religion ever has .
&quot; I find it interesting your weak way of discrediting a reputable scientist , but say noting of Ruse who has said himself that Behe is a reputable scientist . &quot; Yet Michale Ruse himself is a philosopher , not a Scientist . You also give no context for that statement . &quot; I suppose because you say it that it is true , then it is true . &quot; No , I say it &apos; is true &apos; because the evidence strongly suggests that it is true.I find it rather interesting that you would name &quot; Debating Design &quot; then go on to talk about the flagellum ... when one of the essays in Debating Design demonstrates how that flagellum is &apos; irreducibly complex &apos; . &quot; Collins arguments are not philosophical they are mathematical and measurable . For example just one parameter : if gravity were stronger by only one part in a trillion trillion trillion the universe would have collapsed back on itself . &quot; Yes , but also not very accurate . We do not know how variable gravity can be , it may be that there are only a few possible values for gravity to have . Saying that because we exist gravity must have this value is not a reasonable statement ... rather we exist because gravity has that value . &quot; Guillermo Gonzalez , Jay W Richards &quot; I have never been a supporter of the &quot; Rare Earth Hypothesis &quot;
&quot; What evidence ? &quot; In broad terms there is the fossil record , genetic analysis of modern species , the result of biological experimentation , the emergence of new species in environments that have only existed for a short period of time . &quot; Whats your point ? &quot; the flagellum has been shown to be &apos; reducibility complex &apos; and thus does not serve as an example of &apos; irreducible complexity &apos; . &quot; Yes , fantastic so we agree . Gravity is only one of the many examples . And your argument on gravitation is what Collins is saying . Gravity has its exact value , Therefore we exist . Its a measurable parameter . &quot; That does not mean that gravity was set at that value by a designer ... We exist because gravity has that value , gravity does not have that value so that we can exist . &quot; Supporter or not , the evidence is there . &quot; Our observations are far to limited to make that assumption , but given the number of planets observed so far it seems quite likely that most stars have planets , and thus it seems quite likely that there would be other planets capable of supporting life ( assuming that life needs a narrow set of parameters to survive ) . &quot; and finally a challenge to you . Tell me what of life &apos;s origins ? Where and how did life com about ? &quot; There are still a good number of theories out there being researched ... but a &apos; rough &apos; description would be as follows.The early oceans of the world were rich in a wide variety of complex chemicals , the byproduct of chemical reactions that had started when the earth was still a cloud of interstellar dust . Among these chemicals were replicator molecules , complex organics that react with the chemicals around them to form other replicator molecules . This replication was not perfect , and so the replicators changed ... some changes led to improved replication ( faster or more accurate ) and thus those replicator molecules became the dominant form . Over time these replicators reacted with other environmental elements such as the lipids that form cell walls to form the earliest cells .
Maybe some of the praise for your recovery should be reserved for the medical team who were there to help you through it . People generally seem to account all of the good things that happen to them as being attributable to God and discount all of the bad things . It &apos;s a ridiculous notion . It &apos;s a textbook case of specious reasoning . Why do you curry favour with God more than a child left to die in Africa . Why doesn &apos;t he step in to help them ? Quite simple really . He doesn &apos;t exist .
We can observe the presence of a black hole by seeing how the stars behind it distort or by observing the accretion disk that forms as a black hole siphons matter from a near by star.Black holes are also defined mathematically ... appearing in the Theory of Relativity long before they were observed ( the math is really quite enjoyably elegant ) .
Get it in to your head Jesus was not a christ he was just an ordinary man going around with a lot of men , making magic which at that time people would believe all they were told and thought it was true . God is supposed to be invisible knows everything , let him stop wars then , stop poverty , stop priests abusing children , islam women burning themselves to death for fear of what their husbands will do to them . People are still trying to get on the band wagon and make themselves important . Even some will confess to a murder they have &apos;nt done to get notarity . Why does your god hate me so , i dont hate him . No answer to that I suppose . If a priest told you that he had seen Elvis Presley lat week would you believe him . Well maybe you would after all he only speaks gods word .
Faith is belief without any evidence at all . Personally , I always insist on at least some evidence for important matters , particularly when the item concerned is highly implausible . Since you mention it , can you name 5 &quot; archaelogical and &quot; ( / or ) &quot; historical correlations &quot; ( whatever that is supposed to mean ) &quot; to stories &quot; ( and that is just what they are , stories , fiction ) &quot; presented in the bible &quot; , for me to consider ? And don &apos;t mention Josepheus .
Mkovach is reaching for an old argument that one can find in Aquinas and elsewhere . As he states it , though , it has some amusing consequences . If something is omnipotent because it can do all things that are possible , I am omnipotent because I , too , can also do all things that are possible . The fact that I can &apos;t bench press 300 pounds doesn &apos;t disprove my omnipotence since that &apos;s clearly something I &apos;m not able to do , i.e. it isn &apos;t possible . What is possible , I can readily do . Maybe I &apos;m God . By the way , why should anybody entertain for an instance the notion that there is anything omnipotent in the universe ? Mkovach is assuming both that omnipotence is a meaningful attribute and that something possesses it . Unfortunately , omnipotence is just the answer to the absurd game of &quot; let &apos;s now come up with the best thing that might be true about our tribal deity . &quot; I &apos;m reminded of arguments I had with my friends in grammar school about whether the universal solvent was able to dissolve itself , etc . One last note : mkovach writes &quot; God cannot contradict himself . &quot; I , however , am able to contradict myself . Therefore I am greater than God because I have an ability he lacks .
The point of previous post was not to present valid arguments . My sophistries are , obviously , designed to be absurd . Thing is , they aren &apos;t a great deal different than your arguments , which you claim to take seriously.It &apos;s possible to make sense out of the notion of an omnipotent deity--Aquinas did so--but Aquinas could provide a philosophical context in which omnipotence made sense . Now there have to be very few folks left , including religious folks , who seriously accept the mix of Neoplatonic and Aristotelian ideas that gave traditional theological ideas their cogency . It &apos;s not that anybody is trying to diss the great theologians of the Middle Ages . I respect them very much myself and have spent many years admiring them , in part for their sheer technical virtuosity . It is quite impossible , at least for me , to credit their universe of discourse , however . The God game , at least the traditional version of the God game , is over . Which , naturally , doesn &apos;t mean that you can &apos;t make money selling it on television.Absent an appropriate philosophical setting , omnipotence is an empty word . Or doesn &apos;t claiming that God and human are ontologically different commit you to having an ontology ? What sort of being is a god ? And if , in your utterly inadequate human ignorance , you can &apos;t tell me what you &apos;re talking about , why are you presuming to talk at all about something which , for all you know , is my uncle &apos;s pocket watch . ( Don &apos;t tell me that it doesn &apos;t make sense that a pocket watch could save souls . Maybe that &apos;s just another one of those mysteries of the faith . ) It &apos;s not that I &apos;m so enthusiastic about my own ontological status , by the way . Indeed , one of the many things I find absurd about Christianity ( and Islam , for that matter ) is the absurd credit they give to humanity , as if the maker of heaven and earth had any reason to become man--the Islamic version of this vanity is that Satan fell out of resentment for the grand destiny that Allah had apportioned to human beings . Well , long ago a man named Xenophanes remarked that if asses had gods , they &apos;d have long ears ...
Because the realm of science is slowly consuming the realm of religion . It wasn &apos;t so long ago that religion was used to explain how the Sun moved through the sky , and where sickness came from . And now we have physics , biology , and a host of other bodies of knowledge.It &apos;s reasonable to assume that this trend will continue . Therefore , it &apos;s also reasonable to wonder what remaining areas of religion will be replaced by science .
Then where did the almighty jackass himself come from ? You answer that one . If everything cannot come from absolute nothineg , then where did your God come from ? And science does answer why . Why life on Earth ? Because our planet is in the a certain spot around the sun that allows an atmosphere and liquid water at the surface . Booya bible thumper
A scientific answer is easy . &quot; Why not ? &quot; Sorry to answer your question with a question , but you &apos;re operating on a potentially false premise , that everything has to have a reason for being.Obviously , if you want God to have created everything , then you &apos;re going to invent evidence to reinforce that belief .
What about the creation story with the world being created in 7 days . I do not think science can ever support that story .
science can attempt to evaluate whether there seems to be a why , and i think it could make at least a significant case that there isn &apos;t . Christians , Muslims , and Jews all believe in the God of Abraham , yet all have different stories , different traditions and different morals. there were 1000 &apos;s of gods before that one which we now believe do not exist. at a time with very little understanding of the earth &apos;s place in the universe , we created stories that tried to describe how and why we are here. as science described the how , god became smaller and smaller , but our desire for purpose and science &apos;s inability to disprove our desire , we have left to god the reasoning rather than throwing out the immaterial god with the material one .
For obvious reasons : religions claims to explain the foundation and structure of the universe without good enough evidence . It is therefore the duty of scientific thinking people to point that out - that the evidence is flawed
I have seen a lot more negative reactions than positive.Take for example stem cell research .
Oh well , if you don &apos;t think that gravity is a fact , why don &apos;t you prove the theory by jumping off the top of the nearest tall building ? With regard to abiogenesis , formation of polypeptides is not thought to be the first component . RNA ( or some early simpler version of it ) is thought to be the first critical component , because RNA has both catalytic and reproductive properties , so it can do the jobs of both proteins and DNA . Evolution has nothing to do with abiogenesis . Claiming that because evolution can &apos;t explain the origin of life proves intelligent design is just ludicrous . ID is not supported by ANY evidence ; it is a theory without any scientific support .
Religion and science must be compared because science is the basis for everything else , why wouldn &apos;t you apply science when determining if god is exists or not ? This is an absurd argument !
&quot; as a Catholic , I DO believe in God &quot; nice tautology but that &apos;s not really a reason for believing is it ? If your kid asked you why you belive and didn &apos;t just accept because your Catholic , how would you explain it to them
So you believe even though you have no evidence for or against , you just have faith because you have faith because you have faith .... You are a classic drone because if you accept no evidence nothing can sway you , your mind is closed . In the real world nothing is for certain but everything can be backed with some kind of evidence . If it can &apos;t it doesn &apos;t exist .
The bible is not proof for god . That would be considered circular reasoning .
exactly . Molecules do not randomly fit together- they have a certain shape that predisposes them to fitting to some but not others - then they build up bigger forms that un-randomly fit to other molecule clusters and so on . The randomness is only if and when they will coma against forms that fit . Most of the time they bump into molecules that dont fit .
Bibledefendy &quot; It doesn &apos;t make sense to say that if you look at a car , that somehow everything crashed together and made a car that RUNS . &quot; It is ironic that you say this . We are saying the same thing.It doesn &apos;t make sense to say that if you look at a creator , that somehow everything crashed together and made a creator that CREATES .
Even if we accept that , how could we possibly know anything about the initial force that created the universe ? How do you know the universe wasn &apos;t created accidentally ?
A supernatural accident then : ) The universe is a bubble that happened to form in the supernatural river that has always existed.So say we accept an initial force , so what ? Where do you go from there ?
&quot; Where do you go from there ? &quot; That &apos;s it . Once somebody accepts that there is an initial force , he has to realize it is a supernatural being ( because it cannot logically be a natural being ) and a god or gods will follow suit . Thus &quot; initial force = god / gods &quot; .
No , the initial force could have been non-intelligent , like in my river example . You &apos;re just stretching the word &quot; God &quot; to mean &quot; any possible initial force . &quot; In conventional usage , &quot; God &quot; means &quot; Intelligent being who created the universe . &quot;
Once again , in response to the video . If there are two ultimatums , that Everything came from nothing , or that it always existed , then why does the universe have to have a beginning ? You &apos;ve just assumed this and then closed off the causality cycle with the opposite argument .
although your solution is a god with infinite power , infinite knowledge , infinite presence , infinite morality , and has existed infinitly. if 2 infinitly existing planes of energy collided and caused the big bang - that would require infinite time , but no morality or involvement / presensce in our current universe. there are many explainations that do not require a god to create our universe - the fact that we haven &apos;t narrowed it to one for you does not mean the demonstrably flawed bible is correct
Read &quot; a New kind of science &quot; by Stephen Wolfram . It is a book about complexity theory that goes to show ( with mathematical computer simulations ) that complex forms and structures are more likely to have a simple set of initial conditions than complex . In fact if the intial conditions are complex almost all of the time the forms / structures that follow are simple
Or , you could actually do some research and find out that there are processes by which complexity can be created from simplicity . ( EX : Evolution , Conway &apos;s Game of Life , Chaotic systems , etc . )
Great story , unfortunately in this setting it is meaningless without evidence . Christians often use emotionally charged stories of miraculous recoveries because people are too afraid to ask for the evidence .
it is left over from when we had no answers to these questions so we made answers up. the idea of a god was around long before the bible - were those gods all made up ? ? - then why not one more
evolution more aptly explains the morals that we have than god. competition is better explained by competition by groups for resources than a god that says thou shalt not covet , and love thy neighbor as thyself
That &apos;s not it at all . Emotions are completely natural , animals show compassion all the time , this is why you dog licks you and why you don &apos;t fk with a bear &apos;s cubs . What does the existence of a creator have to do with the possibility of love ? That &apos;s such a random association .
every time we try to assign to god some specific act , science comes along and shows plausible ways it could happen without god . The Miller Urey experiments of the 1950s showed you could take elements present in the early stages of earth and apply electricity to simulate static electricity / lightning - the result was amino acids and oganic compounds. the fact that inorganic can turn into organic and that better and more complex beings can come from lesser beings are both easily observable and all that is necessary for evolution to explain our existence .
what absurdity is this then you want to say that a person will escape hell if he believes in god .............................. then i think so all the terrorists and wrongdoers will escape HELLIn my opinion our conscious is the HELL , if you do wrong it will hurt you ..... it is not going to see if u believe in GOD or NOT
If I was to say the invisible flying speghetti monster exists and created the god that you believe in - how would you prove that it doesn &apos;t.You might try finding the origination of that belief and discrediting it source , by finding inconsistencies within the beliefs , or inconsistencies with what they believed and our current knowledge.for example - if a religion believed : there was an earth with water and grass and trees and night and day - before there was a sun or moonGen 1 : 1-16that the sun and moon are in our atmosphereGen 1 : 8,14god created animals then man and woman in Gen 1 : 24-27 but also he created man first , then animals , then woman in Gen 2 : 18-22Sons of God ( nephilim ) had sex with the daughters of men and created giants Gen 6 : 2-4the omniscient , all powerful , all good creator god regretted creating everything and decided to kill all humans , plants , and air and land animals less than 1700 years after creation , but decides to let one 600 year old man build a football field sized boat and get all the animals and enough food for them to live more than a year at sea since there was enough water to cover the entire earth more than 22 ft higher than the tallest mountain Gen 6 : 6-7God told Noah to take a male and female of every animal Gen 6 : 19-20 and four verses later says to bring 7 pairs of every clean animal and 2 of animals that are not clean Gen 7 : 2all in the first seven ( out of 50 ) chapters of Genesisif you were to read a book like this that was not called the bible - you would likely wonder what crazy stuff people were smoking in thise days
Simple , we &apos;ve documented evolution in current years . We &apos;ve seen it happen . Yes , the chances are very small that something will successfully evolve which is why it takes millions of years for new species to arise.For example , the monkey family has an extra set of chromosomes . WELL GOD MUSTA DID IT ! No , occasionally in evolution , a set of chromosomes will become fused . Chromosomes have end caps on them to tell RNA where to stop coding . Chromosome 3 in our genome is actually a smashed together 15 and 16 from the monkey family , proven by the matching DNA and the site on the chromosomes where there are two end caps are illogically joined . Then there &apos;s fossils and anthropological remains to show the progression . That &apos;s how . Do your research .
an example of the fear employed to get people such as yourself to believe i suspect
Oh really ? ... I think its safe to say that i dont need to depend on a imaginaryman to persue my dreams and live a good life .
You seem to think that at the same time the big bang happened the earth was created . The earth is about four billion years old , but the big bang happened somewhere between 13-14 billion years ago . The gases that made up the earth came according to big bang theory ultimately from that big bang - but not ( and this is important ) all at the same time . All-at-the-same-time is the bible version of creation , remember.This is the problem with many of the arguments the religious side makes here - you make up a simplified straw-man out of what you believe one theory or another says and have obviously not studied these theory &apos;s , probably because you live in parts of your country where religion has such a stronghold that you don &apos;t get to learn these things . This forces us to spend most of our time correcting your ridiculous and flawed statements - and then some of you get very hurt when we assault your intelligence . At least we have studied the foundation of your claims
only moves the question - bible just says god did it , and when asked where god came from - umm - he &apos;s always been there. yeah , thats it
he spoke to me after that and said he was lying to you - then we had a good laugh ( and a good scotch )
That is attempting to answer a the question of the chicken or the egg in disguise . You have a good point , but it does not prove a god exists .
Science is not a &apos; matter of faith &apos; it &apos;s a matter of evidence . There is evidence to support both &apos; the big bang &apos; theory and evolution . See link below :
&apos; .. regardless of which side you &apos;re on , you &apos;re there based on faith . &apos; No faith is the belief in something with inadequate evidence and in the case of God , lots of evidence to the contrary . Science is based on evidence . &apos; Science and a belief in God do not have to be mutually exclusive of each other . &apos; Indeed . There are scientific reasons why people believe in gods . &apos; I believe God intended us seek knowledge and question things ... even Him . &apos; You can believe whatever you want but if it adversely affects the lives of others , you should be held accountable with reasoned inquiry.E.g. I may believe that the sun sets in the Indian ocean every night because my parents and community say so but if I punch those who dissent from my belief I should be forced to face reason with evidence . &apos; For everything science brings to the table , it won &apos;t be able to prove &quot; scientifically &quot; that the universe and everything in it , is a result of random happenstance . &apos; That &apos;s your assumption . Perhaps it &apos;s akin to a 10th century peasant saying &apos; never &apos; when conteplating the lunar landings . &apos; A time came when I realized that there would ALWAYS be something to be discovered .. &apos; So ? &apos; .. I put my faith in God .. &apos; But why ?
just because you have faith and believe in miracles you believe in god .................... point out the godly miracles ........
Postulating a god as the ultimate cause of unexplained complexity solves precisely nothing , because you are left with explaining the origin of this degrees-of-magnitude more complex creative entity .
so if i was french irish does that mean i would have to half-believe in god , or believe in a different god ? If you feel compelled to believe your parents that doesn &apos;t mean they are right .
hmmm - what argument would you use to prove them wrong exactly ? since that is what we are interested in here ...
There is less historical evidence for Jesus Christ than for Robin hood . The scrolls that date before the year 384 after Christ ( when the modern bible was formed for political reasons ) - describe yoshua ( meaning savior in Aramaic , and not a mans name ) as some sort of spirit / ghost . And there is no evidence or historical record of Jesus that dates from the time he was supposedly livingCompare the historical evidence of Buddha for example ( who lived approximately 500 years before Christ ) They practically have the laundry list of Buddha
if you have faith in God you will be happy forever.PLUS ! who created the earth ? God.who made people ? God.who made the meteaor that destroyed the dinosaurs ? God did it all ! ! ! ! !
I don &apos;t think he &apos;s a moron -- quite the opposite actually -- but it &apos;s a simple fact that an atheist would almost definitely not be elected President of the United States . Thus , any politician will have an incentive to delude themselves and avoid thinking about the question too much . So I would say he &apos;s not a moron or a liar , he &apos;s simply choosing not to seriously question his faith .
How dare you jump into a debate with your false premises disguised as a cogent argument ... in order to put down other people &apos;s belief systems and the President of the United States ! What have you done lately ... I guess just spread poison .
Let &apos;s be frank here . Over the past ten millenia mankind has created in excess of a thousand gods . Ultimate gods , pantheons of gods , nature gods , fertility gods , vengeful gods , merciful gods , gods that sleep with humans , gods that walk amongst humans , and gods that commit genocide.To actually entertain a theist when they say &quot; I don &apos;t believe in those 1,000 gods , they are clearly false and wrong , but I believe in this one God , with absolutely no more evidence than any of those others &quot; is ridiculous.I give as much credibility to the silly notion of a christian god as I do to harry potter and Zeus . All of them , entertaining works of fiction.The christian god is just another mark in the book of gods , and will fade with time ( like every single god man has worshiped has ) .
why is it trying to sell me movies bout god FOR ONLY 11.95 ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
been there done that - it is an entertaining read to see what people are willing to believe with sufficient unknowns.for those who haven &apos;t gone back and read again with fresh eyes - here &apos;s a good example of of the fun you can have : The serpent told the truth ! ! re-read the garden of eden fable and you will see that : God told Adam that the day he eats the fruit of that tree he will die the serpent ( who at that time had feet ) said No you won &apos;t die , you will learn the difference between good and evil eve and adam ate the apple THEY DID NOT DIE ! Adam lived 930 more years * they learned the difference between good and evil - just like the serpent said ( and like the name of the tree would suggest ) Moral of the story : God lied ! the serpent told the truth ! to cut it of at the pass for those who say that after eating the apple they became destined to die , keep reading - there was also a tree of life in the garden ( the reason they were kicked out ) which would not be necessary if they were going to live forever from the beginning .
Hold the phone , logical ? Could you explain , please ? The minimum length for an argument is 50 characters . The purpose of this restriction is to cut down on the amount of dumb jokes , so we can keep the quality of debate and discourse as high as possible .
I &apos;m straight.Also , I &apos;ve never attacked anyone in my life . You have the right to your beliefs , which i may or may not agree with , and I have the right to mine . Also , I don &apos;t understand your story- did you shoot blanks at them ? What sort of sixteen year old were you , with three previous assaults ? A violent lunatic ? Also , two sons at sixteen ? Huh , that sounds quite chaste to me . And if homosexuals said to you that you had no rights , wanted to stone you , etc . , then you would be angry . You &apos;re angry for far less . Being gay doesn &apos;t make you a god-hater , nor does being straight make you a Christian . Acceptance is important , and you seem to be really , really short on that trait ! Intolerance is hurting others for their beliefs . Intolerance is using offensive language because you can- whether it &apos;s about one &apos;s race , religion , gender , or sexual orientation . And if you hate gay people so much , move to the Middle East ! they don &apos;t have that problem there .
A moral compass ? Have you READ the Bible ? Try reading through Genesis and Exodus and see exactly HOW moral it is ( Examples of Biblical Immorality : Innkeeper letting his daughters get raped instead of sending out the Angels , genocide that &apos;s ordered by God , infanticide that &apos;s committed by God )
What a pile of ridiculousness . The bible was not created all at once , and it &apos;s many authors definitely didn &apos;t have just one intention . All that God is perfect love talk is just utter white noise . I doubt you even understand what you said . You certainly didn &apos;t make a point.People do not need God or religion to do good things for others . And NO , it is not that hard to do good things for others . Your admission of that proves you need to coaxed by religion to do those good things .
While I agree that the idea f the bible as a moral compass is far more palatable than as a specific description of real-life events , I think it should be noted that people can be good without the Bible , and people can also be terrible within Biblical law.I &apos;m not a Christian , and I still know what is right and what is wrong . Do not hurt others- do not steal , violate , kill , etc . I don &apos;t need a Bible to guide my actions , and yet my actions are still those of a good person .
I almost forgot the best one . What were Jesus &apos; last words ? You would think that might be important to get right , but out of the 4 gospels - Jesus has 3 different last words.Matthew 27 : 46 -About the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice , &quot; Eloi , Eloi , lama sabachthani ? &quot; - which means , &quot; My God , my God , why have you forsaken me ? &quot; Mark 15 : 34 -And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice , &quot; Eloi , Eloi , lama sabachthani ? &quot; - which means , &quot; My God , my God , why have you forsaken me ? &quot; Luke 23 : 46 -Jesus called out with a loud voice , &quot; Father , into your hands I commit my spirit . &quot; When he had said this , he breathed his last . John 19 : 30 -When he had received the drink , Jesus said , &quot; It is finished . &quot; With that , he bowed his head and gave up his spirit .
I affirm this , we forget the logical flaw of attributing somethings complexity to God . &quot; Well , it looks really complicated , THEREFORE something beyond our realm of physics must have done it &quot; . It &apos;s a very vague premise that if something currently unexplainable happened that something beyond all explanation did it.Note also that words like &quot; complicated &quot; and &quot; beautiful &quot; are self-assessed and subjective . It &apos;s statistically a random chaotic mess , it &apos;s easier to gradually learn to like something then have the entire universe arranged specifically to our enjoyment .
Uh ... no.On two levels . Lack of logical possibility and evidence , and secondly , the overwhelming presence of alternatives.We &apos;ve all experienced real-life probability before , it took about 14.7 trillion ( or some ridiculous number of ) years for chaotic matter to cool down and form life on our planet and Earth is only going to be around for a few more millenia . Not very miraculous to me . I &apos;m sure we &apos;re all versed on evolution . We &apos;ve observed the processes of which in nature , and there &apos;s a clear fossil record which tells a story untouched by mankind millions of years back . And in case you &apos;re going to refute this with the incredulous statement that &quot; life came from nothing &quot; . That &apos;s not the case , it gradually developed over a LOOOONG time , and the basic compounds that make us exist all over nature and are generally stable . Ironically , Christians believe that we were pressed from dirt.This eliminates the need for a God to have intervened . Then there is the supposition that a physically impossible being just magically created us , with no possible ability of knowing this except that people from 1000 &apos;s of years ago who were studying , at best , witchcraft , alchemy , and astrology ( not astronomy ) were telling the absolute truth when we simultaneously discredit 2,999 other religions based on the very same credibility.This really has nothing to do with facts and evidence at all . We are trapped into believing in God and Heaven because we don &apos;t like the alternative of permanent death , that noone is watching over us , and that you &apos;ve wasted your life in Church . This principle of &quot; faith &quot; is simply the emotional refusal to grasp what appears to be a harsh reality.We live in a very sheltered country of America . I &apos;m not cynical , but we swim in water while people in Africa ( mostly Christians by the way ) are begging for it while being slaughtered , we work effortlessly while near-slaves at home and abroad manufacture our basic goods while we exploit a useless service sector economy . It is to be expected of us to gate ourselves with our dream world.I accept no . 1 . Morals aren &apos;t that hard to figure out . 2 . I &apos;m okay with dying because living forever , if you think about it , would be true hell and it is the fear of death and limited exposure to life that makes life so precious . 3 . Having accepted these things , I don &apos;t really need a God nor credit one .
this god character ( s ) was made just to make people feel more secure about the things they cannot explain hundreds and thousands of years ago humans could not explain what some things were and why they happened it is just to cover up peoples fears of the world and giving them something to use to shove in peoples faces trying to prove that they are the smarter and the nonbelievers should be the scared ones even though most of the time they are the ones with the actual answers
There is a mountain of evidence to support evolution , such as fossil records , DNA , and selective breeding . Scientists estimate that only 1 in 1000 SPECIES ( not specimen ) ever become fossilized ; and of those we have still only discovered a fraction . So there &apos;s bound to be holes in our ancestral lineage , such as &apos; the missing link &apos; ( the common ancestor we share with Chimpanzee &apos;s and other apes ) . However , despite these tiny odds we have discovered another &apos; missing link &apos; , tiktaalik , the common ancestor we share with all vertebrates . See link for more information .
Just because we don &apos;t know how the world came to be , doesn &apos;t mean God made it . That means we don &apos;t know how it came to be . The same thing can be said about God . How did he / she come to be ? I do not see how it is a bigger leap of faith to say that you don &apos;t know how the world was created than to say that God has been around for eternity , and made the world . And even if there is a God , how can you possibly know that your god is the real god ? Maybe Zeus is the real God . There is simply no way of knowing .
I do not believe in any god or gods . I am a strong atheist , because I have never come across a definition of god that could possibly exist . There is no reason to believe that the gods of any bibles are real , and many reasons why we know they aren &apos;t . A being outside of existence is by definition non-existent . If a being is existing , it must be detectable . In order to be detectable , it must be logically consistent .
How is this a debate ? Am i meant to argue with myself ? Anyway ...
I can not see how what the Bible says is true . How can someone live to over 1000 years old . Humans evolved from Cavemen , and whatever existed before then . The Bible at times simply defies all logic , science and life as we know it . You can argue about religion and science . But science makes the componants of existance and what has actually happened . So the science is 100 % correct and you can not modify this in its complete state . We are mostly talking about the Christian God but what about others ? Muslim god Allah and others ? Do they exist too ? So which God made the world and created life ? 3 solutions here . Either only one exists making all but one religion true . Non of them exist making all of them false or all gods are one also making all reliigions false . Whichever way the majority of belief is flawed and contradicted through other religions . Who says the Bible is fact and the Quaran is false ? God has supposedly created life and brought a beautiful world upon us . He has the power to do anything . Why has he not done any of these so called miracles in our life like turning water into wine etc . The world of today is a sorry state , with murders , diseases and even terrorists . How and why does he let this happen when he can easily stop it ? If thats the case he is supporting terrorism and that is not such a nice creative being ! There has been more evidence to suggest life form on other planets exist more . Did our God create them to ?
&quot; God &quot; , there is no evidence for its existence , and god was invented to explain things people couldn &apos;t understand , and to keep control on ancient civilizations.Firstly the pope says no to free condoms in Africa.Also religion have us Al Qaeda , the holocaust and Bosnian troubles.We need to stop dreaming and enter the real world .
i don &apos;t think there &apos;s a god because i think some people are scared of there being nothing when they die so they want 2 believe in something and kings and queens used gods 2 get there people on there side like the Egyptians i reckon they did it for their god but were really only doing it because thats what their pharaoh wanted . So the pharaoh says the gods have spoken and if they didn &apos;t do it they would go to hell and die over and over again and this would put fear in the peoples eyes , i also the reckon the bible is a fairy tale and just been taking out of proportion . People say there was a Santa Claus so children would be good so how can you trust anything that is said when there is no hardcore evidence .
I believe in gods but not a absolute god such as Jesus christ or Allah that created everything inclusive us human beings . Gods that create everything just didn &apos;t exist in me and the reason is very simple.Gods are said to have supernatural powers of everykind such as looking into the future and reading people thoughts and etc.Here is a point which i wanted to raise regarding the genuity of Jesus professed love for everyone.If God have the power to see the future and if he love us why did he create Adam and Mary when he knew that if Adam ate the apple from the tree , he would have betrayed god . If God loves us and have the abilty to see the future , why did he create us humans when he knew that we would eventually become bad and punish those bad humans by flooding the land ? If God have the ability to see the future why did he create lucifer when he knew that lucifer one day will betray him and god will punish him by banishing to hell ? And why did god put the tree of &apos; not sure what is it called &apos;in the garden of Eden where Adam and Mary lived.If he owns the power to create the universe why is he so unwise to put something that would cause Adam to become a so called &apos; normal &apos;human being ? If god cares for everyone , why did he in the bible say that animals are for humans to consume for food but not kill for fun . Indirectly he is saying that animals are something he created and we can kill for our own advantage . But apparently animals are similar to us human beings too . Animals have feelings like us and they feel pain when the chopper is brought down to their neck . If God is really benevolant to all living things he could just invoke his magic powers and let the animals feel no pain when they are being slaughtererd.But why did he give animals feelings ? And i strongly feel that we humans aren &apos;t suppose to consume animals.Our teeth are harbivourous and our digestive system are that of a vegetarian not a meat eater.We can eat meat yes but not too much as when they die , waste materials in the animals such as Urea will be sstored inside them . When we eat them we eat their waste materials.There are so many inperfections of God and i can hardly name them all in one go.Here is my point and question towards those to believe in god.Why did your beloved god create you when he could just not create you and not make you suffer.Another question : Why did god create us in the first place ? To be his puppets ? For fun ? So that god will not feel lonely ? I heard many weird debaters insulting me as an idoit and so on but this is just my views on christianity and gods that create everything.This argument meant no offense to anybody but is just to express my opinions and beliefs .
First , let me say thank you for leaving a response instead of simply voting me down like the rest of these jerks : ) Now then ... &quot; How do you suppose the Big Bang came to be ? &quot; I don &apos;t know . And neither do you . It is impossible to answer this question . It could have been God . It could have been space aliens . It could have been ten dimensional space rocks crashing together . The universe could simply have always existed . There are an infinite number of possible explanations . &quot; And what about miracles ? &quot; A &quot; miracle &quot; is just something we haven &apos;t found the cause of yet . Do you have any particular examples ? See also : confirmation bias . &quot; look at the intricacy of the trees , etc . &quot; This is the Argument from Design . I respond with the Argument from Poor Design . One example of poor design : In human females , the birth canal passes through the pelvis . If an infant &apos;s head is too big they will not fit and before c-sections death for the mother was the usual result.There are many , many other examples of poor design . To me the evidence points not to an all-powerful , benevolent designer , but rather a universe ruled by non-intelligent patterns emerging from chaos .
presumably if you believe in the big bang then you don &apos;t believe in the god of Abraham from the old testament who created an earth with water and grass and trees and night and day - before there was a sun or moon . Gen 1 : 1-16also , the balance of nature is exactly how evolution works - not a benevolent god. how would the extinction of most species that have ever existed including humanoid species like Neanderthal be considered benevolent ? what was their purpose - if they had none , isn &apos;t it then possible that we would have none ?
what do you use to tell what parts of the bible are completely true and what parts are completely made up ?
yes and no. while i still believe that there is a heaven and god rules heaven , the theory of evolution overrules the belief that god created everything and He rules over all and controls all .
There is no reason why I should . There is no evidence for the existence of a God . The belief would not improve my life at all . I would feel like a child that holds on to belief in Santa even though he sees his parent stuffing the stockings . God is for the weak and indoctrinated .
Sorry , there is no god . I will not accept any claim that comes without any evidence .
A lot of people that don &apos;t follow the Bible have already read it &quot; just in case &quot; and still don &apos;t believe it.Global warming will have global consequences . If the god of the Bible is real , then it &apos;s between him and the person in question.Finally , why only the Bible ? What about the other holy books and the other gods ? They are just as likely to be true .
No . Partly because I wasn &apos;t raised to . Partly because I see no reason to . And partly because I don &apos;t want to . I don &apos;t like the way religious people act , whatsoever . I don &apos;t like churches . They idea of worship is obnoxious . The belief that Jesus is suppose to be my role model , sounds like bullshit.Therefore , if there is a God , he &apos;s not worth my time , mind , or energy . I &apos;m a perfectly decent person without religion and God . And best of all , I &apos;m not a hypocrite ! Woot !
I was raised a Christian , Catholic if you must know . But I have come to doubt God . At most I would call God , if there is one , distant and uninvolved . Science is slowly answering religions main arguments . There is only two main ones left . What happens after death and how the universe began .
There &apos;s no proof that a god exists or not . There &apos;s no proof that prayer works . Until god , any god , shows him / herself in plain sight , and performs a bonafide miracle , then I will remain an atheist .
This question is a definite No-Brainer ! Early in Man &apos;s existence , those people seeking power over their fellows , set up as Medicine-Men - Witch-Doctors - Soothsayers &amp; Sorcerers etc , all claiming to have insights &amp; contact with a &apos; Power &apos; - of sorts . Little effort would be required due to the ignorance &amp; fears of the unknown which must have prevailed at that time.Over millennia , via many devious pious paths , evolution has now landed us with their modern equivalents - Archbishops - Ayatollahs - Imams - Rabbis - Popes plus a host of other hypocritical sect leaders , incessantly brainwashing the largely unthinking masses with their ridiculous &apos; Holy &apos; beliefs.Fouling up our minds with a rag-bag of archaic religiose twaddle doesn &apos;t help at all to further our understanding of this truly awesome Quantum / Astronomical Universe.The need to consult Biblical , Koranic , or any other crap-laden fairy-tales in order to pursue a decent &amp; considerate existence beggars belief ! As with everything , ethics evolve quite naturally.Everyone is infected with an imaginative &apos; Spiritual &apos; tendency , sentimentally induced , that is &apos; merely &apos; the natural wonderment of our existence &amp; surroundings.The Human mind is fundamentally prone to the generation of illusions . Elemental reasoning must be applied to give all &apos; fantasial &apos; thoughts a TRUE perspective ! More common sense via attached link .
This is a close one , but I &apos;d have to say no .
God is just an imaginary figure created by the humans ........... terrorists and wrongdoers escape the punishment in the name of god ............ Hence God is a lame excuse for the people
I must argue here , although , to comfort you believers , I do sometimes doubt my atheist views . How can you prove god to be all loving and forgiving , yet claim he eternally punishes people in hell ? What if God lied ; what if Lucifer was good and God bad , yet God won so he got tell the story . You cannot prove God , just as much as I cannot completely disprove God . This argument will lead no where . My point is , if you argue for God &apos;s existence based on the bible alone , then you have a flawed argument . The bible was written by men , so it is flawed itself and not reliable . One more thing , here is an interesting correlation . As science has improved and knowledge increased , religion and god become less and less fact . Interesting , yes ?
There is simply no good empirical proof for is existence . Miracles , prophets , and religious texts are not empirical . Neither is &quot; proof &quot; that a largely historical text is 100 % correct because it gets some historical details correct .
I BELIEVE that G.O.D stands for governers of destiny and represents the governments of the world.Life is THEIR game of chess and WE ( YOU &amp; I ) are the pawns . &quot;
Hell no ! Im a very proud Atheist and ill keep it that way
No , I don &apos;t believe in god ( s ) - at the same time , I don &apos;t think science disproves god ( s ) , nor would the existence of god ( s ) disprove science . They are not exclusive . It &apos;s absolutely personal , and my idea is no .
No , I don &apos;t . I can ramble on about why but I &apos;m not going to .
&quot; This is a poorly asked debate question . That is like me asking someone from Ireland if they even know who Vishnu or Rama is ( God of India ) . &quot; I &apos;m from the UK and I know who Vishnu and Rama are . I &apos;ll give you a hint ; they &apos;re not the god / s of India . &quot; Without a doubt I do not want to believe that when I die the screen goes black like my TV when the power goes out . That I refuse to believe , I want to think that I stand in front of the golden gates of heaven and that the doors open to me . &quot; You &apos;re not arguing whether or not god exists ; you &apos;re arguing whether or not you want god to exist . Clearly you do , as the life you currently have obviously isn &apos;t enough for you . Wanting something to happen doesn &apos;t make it so , unfortunately . &quot; We can look back into history and we can find flaws in the Bible . The flood that betook the Earth the flood that Noah had built an Arc for . Their are many religions that have their own excuses for the cause of that event ! Back into many ancient religions a flood was caused by the Gods ! &quot; There is absolutely no evidence that a great flood occured on Earth . The reason many religions would share this story is more to do with religions copying other religions ( eg , the copying of christianity from paganism ) . &quot; Think of a blind man , and ask him the question does the color blue really exist ? &quot; An interesting question , but you obviously haven &apos;t thought this through . Asking a blind man if the colour blue exists will normally be greeted with a yes answer . Why is this ? Because every single seeing person he has spoken to can confirm that the colour blue exists . He can be told the science behind it , and taught about how light reflects and refracts from different surfaces . Now let &apos;s consider another scenario . A blind man asks one hundred people if the colour blue exists . Of those one hundred people , some will say yes and some will say no , whilst many others will bicker over exactly what colour blue actually is . Of the people who say yes , when asked how they know the colour blue exists , they can not say because they themselves have seen it . They can only answer that lots of people they asked have seen it , and blue sounds like a really nice colour so they really really hope that it does exist . I wonder if the blind man would be able to give you such a sure answer under these conditions ?
What are you saying ? Many old stories state that a big flood happened at some point , therefore everything the Bible says is true , and therefore God exists ? Can you not see the giant , gaping holes in that logic ?
By &quot; Darwin &apos;s stuff &quot; I &apos;m assuming you mean evolution . That isn &apos;t &quot; just a theory , &quot; it &apos;s a scientific theory . Please tell me you know the difference . Science doesn &apos;t make things up as it goes along , as religions do.And about the other holy texts , you are incorrect . I hope you choose to expand on what you know , but if not , that &apos;s yours to deal with . I &apos;m not going to argue this any longer .
Bravo , well put .
Just because something sucks doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s not true.Don &apos;t you see the foolishness in believing in something simply because you want it to be true ? And the blind man analogy doesn &apos;t work because the blind man could verify the existence of the color blue through rational thought . Science tells us in detail about how the eye and the brain work together to perceive colors . It tells us nothing about God .
&quot; That makes a lot of foolish people in the world billions of foolish people . &quot; Yes , yes it does.It &apos;s true that a blind man believes the sky is blue because he was raised that way . Also it &apos;s true that he would probably believe in God if he was raised that way . However , there &apos;s an important difference : the man can verify that the sky is blue by consulting scientific textbooks . He can &apos;t do that with God.Why is it that I trust a science book and not the Bible ? Because science is based on evidence . Not just what you can see , but anything that can somehow be shown to exist . This belief based on evidence is the foundation on which we can build an understanding of the world . Without a foundation like this , you &apos;re just making shit up .
Before I start , I think it &apos;s best to inform you that I had a strong Christian upbringing and education , so I am quite well versed on the Bible . The difference between you and I is that at one point I actually decided to use my brain and to be honest , I couldn &apos;t be happier ! There you go with that specious reasoning again ! You might want to look up it up before responding next time . I actually feel sorry for people like you who tie their lives to a myth . That &apos;s one thing you Christians tend to overlook . The reality is that you do not need a book to tell you the difference between and right and wrong . Granted , there is a lot of value in the message that the Bible spreads ( and , sadly , a lot of hatred as well .... see the Old Testament ) but it doesn &apos;t make the stories any truer . You might want to consider that notion . It &apos;s quite liberating I assure you.I think it &apos;s fantastic that your niece went to Africa to help out however you are devaluing the work that she has done and the good person that she is by implying that she is doing it because God told her to.For the record , my home is in England . I &apos;m sure I can find some disadvantaged children there too if I look hard enough . I fail to see what point you &apos;re trying to make though ...
You mean like the Flying Spaghetti Monster ? No . Not without some kind of evidence .
What absurdity is this DOG is a living thing created by the SCIENCE ........................ God is just an imaginary figure created by the lazy human mind to have lame excuses .................
what are those miracles .............. miracles single handedly can not JUSTIFY the phrase GOD EXISTS
What absurdity is this , the EARTH &apos;S rotation is a natural process .
I was made by SCIENCE ..... SCIENCE existed even before the creation of this UNIVERSE .............. We Humans just gave it a name ..........
GOOD IMAGINATION ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
UNNOTICEABLE ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? so you want to say that GOD is real and you can sense him only if you are a CHRISTIAN .............
weedonald - you said : &quot; A supreme Being is totally perfect therefore cannot be measured , defined or even &quot; sampled &quot; as per the scientific method , but if we could ... &quot; Isn &apos;t your assumption based , in part , on the subjective concept of perfection ? By removing God from man &apos;s capability to define god you can not both say God exists and God does not exist . In essence , you &apos;ve defined what you state can not be defined by creating a definition . &quot; God , if he or she exists , is above dimensional space and time ... &quot; - Again , this creates the same loop as above but this time resting on the assumption that extra-dimensional space and time exist to support the position that God exists . &quot; We cannot , by definition ever understand or know The First Cause ( God ) because we are only capable of anthropomorphizing any Creator or Force that is metaphysically beyond us . &quot; - I &apos;ll defer to my prior arguments and note that this point is what paradoxically refutes your own arguments .
This personal , religious belief is NOT any &quot; proof &quot; that God exists , period .
I say no because they made him up as a lazy excuse for how everything was made because back then they didn &apos;t know about what was going on in space . But today people can make a better guess on how the earth and us where made .
In spite of the complete and total , whole wrongness of your assertion , God still doesn &apos;t exist .
There presently isn &apos;t a single piece of evidence for the existance of a god , so no .
Well , in a way , yes . All of the evidence that has been presented ( in forms of encounters with god via prophets etc . ) are all not really very credible . They &apos;re still &quot; evidence &quot; per se , but not credible evidence .
I am an Atheist meaning I do not believe in &quot; God &quot; of course . I was raised by two Very Christian parents and yet I still do not believe in &quot; God &quot; I believe in logic , not religion it makes all the more sense to believe in logic than religion . All ten of the &quot; plagues &quot; from the bible can be explained by reason and logic . I mean I do not look down at anyone who believes in &quot; God &quot; because it is their life and their choice . I am simply just stating what I believe .
Concerning the blind guy and the color blue thread , You missed another very important aspect of that analogy ( not that you &apos;re not already getting beat up enough over it . ) But the most important difference of all is that , you are not blind.It &apos;s not a matter of a bunch of people who do see , then telling one who does not about a color.It &apos;s a matter of a bunch of people , all of which can see , telling eachother that a color none of these visually able individuals have ever seen , exists.You see ? Why would it be do you think , that you , who obviously believe in god , has not witnessed this god ? Wouldn &apos;t god want everyone who believed in him to know they weren &apos;t just wasting their time with all that praying and church ? I mean , there &apos;s examples all over the bible of him making himself known in some observable way.Why not to you ? If you believe.Hm , maybe you &apos;re not good enough.Maybe he &apos;s testing you , or just doesn &apos;t like you.Whatever the reason , no one has seen much of anything from him for a couple thousand years at least.It doesn &apos;t make sense to me that there even would be a god.But if there were , he just seems like kind of an asshole at this point , and I wouldn &apos;t want much to do with him either way .
There is no evidence to show God does exist so , as for now God does not exist .
hahaha why do people still ask this question ? ? I honestly dont think god exists , has he done anything for us ? if there is I mean you look at it the bible is a rip off of like a million different religions and there is no credible evidence pointing to the existance of this oh so benevolent being . I mean if god exists i guess zues and buddah do to . Oh and another thing ethiopia is the oldest christian religion yet where is this god when there dying like it &apos;s going out of fashion ? so no god doesnt exist and if you want to argue the point come out with some evidence that doesnt come from a book of lies .
People used to tell stories to children . These stories are passed on and extended . Children brains can be formed , so children will believe those stories to be true and pass them on . The stories have become religion . That is why people believe in stories from bible , koran etc and therefore think that there is a god . We could also believe to live on a toe nail of a really big giant ( guess what the score on a debate with that statement would be ... ) . There is no god unless we have strong indications or proof which we don &apos;t so there is no reason to think that this statement is true . Stories from the past are no proof or even indications as they are mostly made up.If you believe in god , you are brainwashed pretty well by parents and / or society . ( to be verified by the fact that your belief matches the belief of people around you ... )
He dose not because if he did everything would be awsome .
My entire family and friends circle is religious and believes in God , but I do not . Being this really IS an ambiguous question , if we did this statistically with the world &apos;s viewpoint , it &apos;d be what ? 90 : 10 ? Something of that sort , and thus God exists simply because 90 % of the world believes he does . As I said , even though I &apos;m not religious , I spend a lot of my time analyzing the origin of religion and how and why people prefer it so badly . I personally don &apos;t think he exists because I overall don &apos;t care . I don &apos;t see a point to wanting to believe he exists , because I &apos;m completely fine as a human being without his existence to me personally . However , I also think he is merely a mythological creation . We &apos;ve got all those fairy tales that make up the world of Disney , that are so incredibly famous because they all have one thing in common : a happy ending . And that &apos;s why I think people cling to religion like they cling to a good fairy tales ... because the idea of death and dying sucks so much , everyone likes the idea of life continuing on ... in heaven ! The land with no boundaries ! But really , in a sense , I &apos;d believe in God the same way I believe in Santa Clause , but I &apos;m too rationalized to see the point in doing so.Also , like someone else said , I believe the idea that the bible and religion were started when they were because perception was limited . In the times of the bible , there &apos;s not one mention of the planets , or microorganism , and that was because they were out of their ability to see . Instead , they decided a sickness was granted because of God , or a meteor was punishment because of God . It was an easy way to believe why everything was happening ... because of the act of just ONE entity.Now , if anything I said was truly accurate , my only question is why all these religious people don &apos;t step out of their boxes and agree with me . But they don &apos;t . And that alone makes me question how wrong I could be about it because can 90 % of the world really be that ... different ? That close minded ? That much of a follower ? But then again , everyone thinks Disneyland is the happiest place on Earth too , so maybe it &apos;s a lost cause . 90 % of the world just really might be that alike .
God is made for stupid adults and young children to give them a conscience . Nothing more nothing less
No . Many people believe that Gods do exist but till date , there is no definite answer to this question . This has been a myth for centuries . Be it Christians or Buddhists there bound to be some kind of God that these people believe in . Sadly , this has not been scientifically proved that Gods do exist.No offense but I feel that this is a propaganda to make people devoted to one &apos;s religion . See , you go to Churches or the temples and pray , study the bible , etc . But are they really true ? Just like what many people say about Jesus-- he wanted to save his villagers so he sacrificed himself and got pinned ( literally hammering his hands and feet ) onto logs which make up the letter &quot; t &quot; and was left there to bleed to death . &#91; Sorry if I got the wrong story but it should be something like that &#93; How true is this ? No one can reassure . Any one can just make up stories with no prove and evidence . It depends on how much or how far one believes in that so-called story.For me , I feel that Science explains almost everything . Without Science , one will not know why or how things work . We would all be a bunch of morons , obeying what others say or do . And because there is no explanation to this , I would rather choose not to believe in this ( to a certain extent ) Therefore , I do not go with the motion agreeing that God do exist .
NO.God is really not there .............. It is just an imaginary figure which has created laziness in the minds of the people
The idea of being alone in the universe can be scary . It is comforting to think that there is someone looking out for us , loving us , telling us how to live good lives , saving a place for us after we die , and it is convenient to have an explanation for all the overwhelmingly confusing origins and mechanics of life and nature . I write this specifically with Christianity in mind , but most religions give varying answers to the important questions of how we got here , why we are here , and what happens next . The concept of powerful supernatural being / beings is a very convenient way to allay all those curiosities and keep people from having to think too hard about them.So for me , it makes sense that the invention of God / gods is just a defense mechanism against confusion and spiritual crises . But the fact is that , despite a diversity of beliefs and &apos; true paths &apos; , no one on this earth knows better than anyone else what the truth is .
No one will ever be able to &quot; prove &quot; that God either exists or doesn &apos;t exist . Religion is based on FAITH &amp; feelings , and science is based on FACTS &amp; reasoning . Nary the two shall meet IMHO .
i too believe in god but its just r imagination or it is just in d minds of people who cannot actually do anything without d concern of others , &amp; as it is quite insulting to ask someone every time about everything they do , even though he / she is v.close to us.So old people considered a mythic person to tell &apos; em wat to do or wat not to do but it is their heart who orders &apos; em to do d job.And these mythic persons r d great people who once lived on earth &amp; brought glory to the society and altogether every society or religion has a HERO , so these men &amp; women OR in other words GODS &amp; GODESSES r still considered alive in their spirit or ghost forms.Wat do people actually do ? at d time of crisis or according to students like me , v remember god at d time of exams only.Well , if v see through d indian culture , people put a type of powder on their forehead v which is made of sandal wood , wat people think is dat it purifies their body sins &amp; apply it on d forehead and neck but d main reason y this is done is not seen by d indians . As sandal wood cools d forehead and d neck old people living in past said it was something done for so called the god . So it is simple to understand dat this all was only &amp; only about logic.It is just about d scientific reasons which has forced d people to take it in a way dat is interesting &amp; entertaining too.I still believe dat god does not exist but i will continue to worship it coz it is like a friend who tells me everything or it is just my own conscience .
there aint any prove to prove tat GOD exist well jesus christ .. we never really seen him or took a picture why do people say that they exist ... have they ever met GOD be4 ? why i say its just a make believe so tat people would buy their bibles and earn cash and people would donate cash ..
Nothing . The Church in this case took a perfectly legitimate position . As I said in one of my other arguments if you believe the bible to be true then you shouldn &apos;t need other proof . Historians on the other hand do . This was my only point . I personally need proof for my beliefs , not faith ... but that &apos;s just me .
That &apos;s certainly a possibility .
This is true , but in the Bible it was stated that hundreds of people saw this event
So you &apos;re attempting to use the bible as a reliable source for the bible ? Are you serious ?
So if you believe the bible then this is all the proof you need.A historian on the other hand would see that much of the bible was written about a hundred years after Jesus died , and that there are no secondary sources confirming it , therefore historically there is no proof of his existence . So any belief must be on faith alone , not evidence .
&quot; But that &apos;s not what the Bible says ... &quot; You &apos;re right . The bible says to kill gays and to kill unbelievers . It preaches hatred and discrimination in the worst way . It pretends that it preaches a holy , merciful message . But it legitimizes hatred , intolerance and murder.The ironic part is your precious Bible isn &apos;t even original . Your silly creation stories ( yes , your bible has more than one of them ) can be found in Sumerian texts that predate the old testament by centuries , even millenia . Which makes sense - the Hebrew tribes would have been decendent from Sumerian tribes . In fact , most of Genesis ( the Ark and the flood ? Pah-leeze ) can be very easily traced to earlier , non-jewish stories.But I &apos;m sure it &apos;s just god spreading seeds of dissent to test the resolve of believers . Keep denying logic , fact and the truth of your very existence . I &apos;m sure your god is pleased .
unfortunately there have been people in this world who were told by mere mortals that Jesus is our savior , a man. freedom of religion promotes these things however silly they sound , you see , Mary cheated on Joseph and came up with the best story ever ! told and retold even today. give her credit for that , or blame society for its ignorance , I vote stupid
One does not have to believe that Jesus was the Lord to believe in his teachings . &quot; Do unto others as you would have them do unto you &quot; ( and many other sayings ) is smart thinking for just about anyone ... regardless of whether or not they came from some fake Sky Fairy .
The Bible was written decades &amp; decades after Jesus supposedly walked the Earth , period . &quot; more that 95 % of sales made from the bible are donations &quot; What does this prove ? ? Absolutely nothing !
Everything works the way it would if there was no god , therefore there &apos;s no reason to believe there is a god . Just like there &apos;s no reason to believe in Zeus or apollo .... Etc
It &apos;s not God who orders that though is it ? Perhaps I am not getting your point , because your original argument seems to me to rest entirely on how belief in a &quot; perfect , wise &quot; creator being affects human behavior . And my point is , not always in good ways . Sometimes in good ways ( as I have posted on at greater length ) , and sometimes in very horrible ways . The question wasn &apos;t about the existence of a god , but about belief in a god , and as an extention how such beliefs affect human actions .
it does not have to be God that orders it - it is their belief in God that allows them to rationalize their behaviour
You put to &#91; o &#93; much emphasis on man.This whole discussion is about how belief in a god or gods affects humankind -- not about your personal belief system . Emphasis on man &apos;s reactions and how a belief in a god affects said reactions is , in fact , the entire topic of the debate here.one of the ten commandments &#91; is &#93; thou &#91; &#93; shall not kill.One of the other 10 commandments - in fact the 1st -- is that &quot; thou shalt have no other gods &quot; business that is the source of so many holy wars.As a point of interest , the original text of the Sixth Commandment read &quot; thou shalt not kill other Israelites . &quot; You could kill all the Canaanites , Babylonians , Akkadians et. al. that you liked.I have never known of any Christian . . . to ask for anybody to be put to deathYou &apos;ve never known of Christians asking for someone to be put to death ? Then you &apos;ve not read history . Start with imperial Rome and its campaigns throughout Europe and Asia , and also pay particular attention to the Reconquista , all nine of the Crusades into western Asia , the Saxon Wars and spread of the Holy Roman Empire , the Baltic Crusades , the Inquisition , the Reformation , the European witchcraze , the conquest of the Americas , the McCarthy era , and the bombing of abortion clinics by wingnutty members of &quot; Christian Century . &quot; I &apos;d be mighty surprised if you could find a single ten-year block anywhere in the last 1500 years during which Christians were not asking for some other group of people to be put to death .
1 ) The Christians persecuted the pagan Romans with far , far more fervor than the pagan Romans had when &quot; persecuting &quot; Christians . Persecution of Christians prior to the conversion of Rome was occasional and local ; the laws were directed primarily at clergymembers and at &quot; church property . &quot; Extermination of non-Christians after the conversion of Rome , on the other hand , was a wholesale pogrom that lasted until Rome itself was no more.2 ) The original Sixth Commandment used a word for &quot; murder &quot; that only applied to the unjustified killing of Israelites . By definition , one could not &quot; murder &quot; a non-Israelite . So the commandment is more accurately translated as &quot; don &apos;t kill your own . &quot; Had it been a blanket prohibition on killing , the Israelites would have been in violation of it quite routinely , as they attacked plenty of neighboring non-Jews.3 ) If &quot; true Christians &quot; never asked for anybody to be put to death , then by your own admission the entirety of your religion has been a big steaming pile o &apos; horsehockey throughout its whole history , because Christians have been doing that since Christianity first appeared , and they still are.4 ) Not associating Catholics with Christians is looney-tunes . Catholics are the original , biggest , and most powerful Christian denomination . And the fact that &quot; one of the main reasons why pilgrims left England was because of their freedom of religion to not be persecuted by Catholics &quot; totally supports my point . Not only have the Christians been killing the non-Christians since time out of mind , but when they run out of non-Christians to kill they turn on each other . The Protestants and Catholics in England were equally brutal towards one another . Then the Protestants came to the Americas and massacred the native folks here . 5 ) You &apos;ve reduced your position to &quot; Christian equals me , and anybody who thinks exactly like me . &quot; Most self-defined &quot; Christians &quot; would not agree . You are not the authority on who is and isn &apos;t a &quot; Christian . &quot; Hell , in my opinion , NONE of you are real &quot; Christians &quot; since you all blatantly ignore the teachings of Christ , who advocated giving up all worldly possessions and living an aesthetic lifestyle devoted to god . But leave that as it may , objectively the &quot; Christians &quot; are the people who define themselves as &quot; Christians , &quot; and they &apos;ve killed loads and loads of folks . So nope , still not buying your BS ( &quot; belief system &quot; ) here .
I say the priest who taught my sophomore Christian History and Theology class says you &apos;re wrong .
Oh well , I would rather be cursed than blessed by a priest.Amen ! ; ) ( I joke a little . Really it would depend on what faith the priest practiced and what the curse or blessing was meant to do . But it was a great opportunity to use the word &quot; amen &quot; in a totally tongue-in-cheek fashion . )
if the non-divine punishment was not enough then atheists would have a much higher rate of criminality which is not the caseonly by challenging the law have we progressed this far - otherwise we would still have slavery and complete ownership and subjugation of women ( yes , it is in the new testament not just the old - see 1st Timothy ) http : / / www.humanreligions.info / violence _ and _ crime.html # Childhoodhttp : / / www.rationalresponders.com / forum / sapient / atheist _ vs _ theist / 4149
You &apos;ve missed the point haven &apos;t you . I haven &apos;t at one point said I myself believe in God . Even though I do . Not very strongly ... but I do.So you &apos;re telling me the world would be better off believing there was no God ? EVER.Again you &apos;ve missed the point of this debate . In a debate .. you don &apos;t just make one statement .. you got to have something to back it up . All you &apos;ve done is make up a sentence.Groans ...
weedonald said : &quot; It is philosophically , logically and scientifically impossible to prove that God exists or does not &quot; I totally agree , and defer you to Occam &apos;s Razor.You completely define your own god out of existence and try to claim that helps your case somehow . You provide absolutely nothing other than to claim your claim cannot be claimed , unclaimed , or counter-claimed solely by claiming it is so . God doesn &apos;t exist because he can &apos;t exist , by definition from BOTH sides of the argument.Why don &apos;t mono-theists understand that their belief in a god , is no different than believing in gods . Mono-theists think it &apos;s foolish to believe in multiple gods , but are aghast and dumbfounded when someone doesn &apos;t believe in their god . All forms of god-worship are simply a waste of the persons time and energy . Only atheism and agnostism are intellectually honest positions as only they are willing to admit that they have not seen or heard OBJECTIVE evidence that the laws of physics can be false .
just making random statements is not an argument in support of the question - if you just want to say you believe in god , go to church
User cmseth wrote , &quot; You make the assumption that God created matter and therefore created the universe . Have you ever considered the idea that God simply organized existing matter to form ( not create ) the universe ? &quot; I thought the whole point of a god was being the creator . Supposing that there was matter around before a god came into existence undermines the very definition of a god . Your argument means that god arose from matter , and that matter is the ultimate creator of the universe and not a god . This makes zero sense at all .
Objection to Objection 3 : Atheistic regimes have slaughtered upwards of 100 million people And religion hasn &apos;t done its share of slaughtering ? How about the unrecorded atrocities committed in the name of god during colonial times ? and the continuing killings going on now the name of that same entity in the middle east and all over the world ? what about sacrifices done to god by the mayans and astecs ? Killings in the name of one god or another are in everyone &apos;s history books . Why continue perpetuating myths ? When you mention atheistic regimes I assume you are referring mostly done by communism , in which case the reason behind it was ideology ... not &quot; atheism &quot; . Whereas in the religious killings , the name of god was actually used as a reason .
re : grounding question ( from above ) : Put 100 devout people in separate rooms and ask them 100 moral questions ( e.g. if a pregnant woman has cancer , can she get chemotherapy to likely save her life if it would likely kill the baby ? ) - you will get many different answers and different justifications - so if there is objective morality , humans cannot converse with god and figure out what it is . We would still be left with subjective morality only we would be judged by a god who has an objective morality and sends people to the lake of fire based on a morality they can &apos;t know .
&quot; Explain to me then how justice is established ? &quot; Isn &apos;t it just as likely that our desire for perfect justice was the impetus to assign this attribute to god ? &quot; Atheistic regimes have slaughtered upwards of 100 million people &quot; Wouldn &apos;t the god that created all the terrible atheists have even that blood on its hands ?
&quot; In what do you have hope ? and not the wishful thinking kind , that does no one any good . The confident certain kind that you can stand on &quot; - seems like you just want to dismiss positive thinking just like atheist want to dismiss god - if thinking good thoughts has just as much positive outcome and hope etc . , then it is just as valid
The problem with pascal &apos;s wager is that it doesn &apos;t say which god you should believe in - using pascal &apos;s logic you should probably just find out which god is the most jealous of belief in other gods , has the best reward and worst punishment . So if the flying speghetti monster promises worse than weeping and gnashing of teeth , then you should believe in it rather than YWYH .
The decent of man more aptly accounts for our dichotomous moral values that treats people of our clan / country / team etc better than others. during the process of evolution we had to learn how to cooperate with human beings to be more successful hunters but compete against other tribes etc. for resources.if we went with : love thy enemy , love thy neighbor as thyself , and to be perfect sell everything you own and follow me - we would have a much different society than we have today
Downvoted , because you copy-pasted your response to me and reposted it as a dispute to someone else with a position not entirely dissimilar from mine .
In order to answer this question the first thing we have to agree upon is on our views of human nature or on the potential of human nature . It seems as the belief in God for the greater good is correlated with the belief that human beings are evil and that have no potential to do good unless they have some belief in a supernatural force . Contradictorily , most religions are based upon the notion that man is a &quot; fallen &quot; creature that needs to be redeemed through rituals , or some sort of metaphysical connection to a higher being . Religion and the belief in God are sustained by the thought that we are evil . The situation we are in right now religions have preeminence in dictating moral standards . Thus , the basis for our understanding of human nature comes from the religious basis that we need some sort of enlightment or redemption to be restored to a higher plane . In this situation the only way to achieve a greater good is through God. thus when yuo say &quot; people turn to atheism and do what they want , &quot; you are assuming that this means they will turn into some sort of savages . This is not true . This is just based on your conception of human nature which comes from religion . I would like to see an interpretation of human nature that is not based on religious premises . One that more objectively demonstrates our potential to be good or bad depending on the environment we are raised , our level of education , and our own genetic disposition .
And how do you account for the vast amount of religious people who also commit &quot; evil &quot; ? I argue that determining what is &quot; right &quot; or &quot; wrong &quot; based on belief is inaccurate and subjective . People do things &quot; because god told me so &quot; ( no matter what god that is ) without questioning why or really thinking for themselves . Scientific reasoning ( I do not mean just science but perhaps the use of the scientific method ) can lead us to find a &quot; greater good &quot; in a more objective way . Why is homosexuality wrong ? Why is sodomy wrong ? A better measure would be to check whether or not your actions are harmful to you or to others , and then measure your behavior accordingly . This is better than just &quot; god told me to do it &quot; which leaves the issue open to having any god tell you any kind of crazy thing &quot; god told me to go kill the abortionists &quot; . There was actually a case a couple of years ago in one state about a pastor who killed a doctor that was performing abortions . And the congregation supported him . Im sure you will say &quot; well , that is extreme , bla bla bla &quot; and make some excuse about how those people were not true followers ... but the thing is , religion is subjective and it is left to ones &quot; relationship with god &quot; . How do you explain to that man that killed the abortionist that his relationship with god is not legitimate ? How would YOU argue for that ? Do you have a direct line to god ? things get easier if we have the means to determine whether our behavior is harmful to ourself or others . Now science can tell us a lot about how to behave in ways that are less harmful to ourself , to the environment , and to society in general . The bible does not say anything about protecting the environment , which is an issue of importance to all of us . But in my personal identification of &quot; right &quot; and &quot; wrong &quot; I say the overuse of pet bottles is wrong , because Ive learned the effects they can have on the environment . - Just an example . What greater goods have come from the belief in God ? I want you to explain to me how religion is NOT subjective . When followers have to listen to a pastor / priest interpret things for them . Or when followers constantly justify their own behavior with an explanation that all that matters is a &quot; personal relationship &quot; with God . I really wonder how God is speaking to all these people directly in ways that contradict each other .
so whats your point ? that everybody should hear two sides to every single story they hear ? The point is to illustrate that more information about a subject leads to better judgment on it . Ideally we should refrain from emitting moral judgments when we don &apos;t have enough information . The point was on how information , not the subjectivity of religion , leads to better judgments. thats because you are talking to religious people using religious answers Evidently , this is your case , as you are trying to pose a defense for god . On questioning . Questioning should not be &quot; overcome &quot; as if it was an obstacle . Questions just need answers . When religious people seek answers in prayer , the answer has a high chance of just being a subjective personal intuition . If religious people would really look for answers they would have to start by first questioning the very existence of god , and requiring proof. you cannot say one has a better law just because it doesn &apos;t agree with your ideologyOf course it is possible to judge whether an ideology is right or wrong , just as it is possible to judge the morality of anything else . Laws that do not give equal treatment to it &apos;s inhabitants , are laws that lack a good morality . When slavery was accepted , for example , the definition of citizen was not applicable to the slaves , as they were not awarded the same rights . I do not agree with it , not because of some &quot; personal ideology &quot; but because I believe all human beings to be equal . In your example of a country that bans homosexuality , I would also find that rather disgusting - how can it be right to judge a person by what he / she does in bed ? are they harmful to society ? how ? Anyway , thank you for showing your low level of maturity . With this , I abstain from the ridiculous debate that you have created . But again , I don &apos;t have enough information to judge you as a good or bad person as I lack the information about your age , your educational level , and the degree of your faith . ... ; - ) cheers . And I didn &apos;t need god to tell me that pre-judging a person is bad ... Or maybe if I had god then I could make a quick prejudgment and say you are a bigot .
Very good points . About the matter of the different direct lines to God , there &apos;s this little funny movie here , which might help religious people see how subjective their own point of view is ... Enjoy ! ^ ^
&quot; With out an author , everything then becomes a matter of personal preference and interpretation &quot; everything is still personal preference and interpretation - which god to believe in , which texts get canonized , and their applicability and meaning given current circumstancesperfect justice , meaning , etc. are only perceived implications - they do not provide evidence for a god , nor specify what god to believe. it is just as likely that we invented and hold on to religion because we want to believe those things exist
Without question God is in favor of men who love him . Christians give more money to charities to than all others combined.I disagree . What is your source ? I &apos;ll bet any person of any religion is just as likely as the next to give to charity . Atheists and agnostics included.Greater is He who is in me than he who is in the world . John 4 4 : What &apos;s the point of quoting the Bible in a debate about god ? Who is that for ? Anyone who thinks like you doesn &apos;t need it , and any who don &apos;t think like you only thinks it &apos;s silly.Our founding fathers built this nation based on God , whether people want to accept it or not it &apos;s all over the and written into the constitution for people that don &apos;t agree with the doctrine than move to another country where there Constitution fits your beliefs more . No dumb dumb , our country was founded on religious freedom , not religion . Most of our forefathers were Deist , which means : &quot; The belief , based solely on reason , in a God who created the universe and then abandoned it , assuming no control over life , exerting no influence on natural phenomena , and giving no supernatural revelation . &quot; You bible thumpers just decided to high-jack the whole thing . &quot; In God We Trust &quot; wasn &apos;t printed on money until 1957 ... 1957 ! for crying out loud ! The only mention any of our founding documents make of a god are two instances where they refer to a &quot; creator &quot; which could mean any damn thing and in no way discounts the possibility of an absence of one.I mean , Benjamin Franklin once said light houses were more useful than churches . Jefferson wrote his own version of the New Testament omitting all of the Jesus stuff . Regardless of what you happen to believe , arguing our country was founded on religion is revisionist at best , and quite against the spirit of the Constitution.It &apos;s not just by coincidence that we have become the most powerful nation on every level in the shortest amount of time in history.Again , this religious revision of our past is a recent phenomenon , and we were doing quite well before you annoying drones begin shoving it down everyone &apos;s throat . I mean , name one &quot; religious &quot; state that isn &apos;t a third world country . Every successful nation in history has separated church and State , including ours . This Evangelical push to make everyone drink the kool-aid can only end in disaster .. However the further we as a nation get further away from God the more kaos and trouble we will face as a nation , and that is happening now.bs. 1. there &apos;s no sign that this country is now any further away from your invisible dude in the sky than ever before , in fact , the religious have more power now than at any time in our history . 2 . The troubles facing our nation are all real problems that praying won &apos;t help , Economy = lack of over site , War in Iraq = a president lying to us about WMD &apos;s ( who was one of your types by the way , real christianly of him ) , Afghanistan = 9 / 11 , Those are the three main problems we have . Notice god plays no role in any of them ... well except of course that the attacks on us on 9 / 11 were in the name of a god .
Without question God is in favor of men who love him.Well , that &apos;s just a crazy bald assertion , and if you want to believe it OK , but it &apos;s not a relevant point . Without question Ma &apos;at is in favor of those who follow her laws ; without question Juno is in favor of wronged wives ; without question Ishtar is in favor of gettin &apos; it on . Those are neat points too , but like yours , not real relevant nor provable as actual fact.Our founding fathers built this nation based on God . . . written into the constitution Well , then , I am REALLY confused as to just what Article VI and the First Amendment are doing in our Constitution . Because the only mentions of &quot; religion &quot; that I remember in the Constitution are the one that starts with &quot; Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of . . . &quot; and the one that reads &quot; no religious test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office . &quot; And the word &quot; god &quot; doesn &apos;t appear in the Constitution AT ALL.I hardly ever see or hear about agnostics giving anything to any charity.I hardly ever see or hear about Christians who aren &apos;t pathological . Following your line of &quot; it &apos;s what I want to see therefore it must be true , &quot; all Christians must be looney-tunes . On the other hand , I know tons of Jews , Buddhists , Hindus , Bah &apos;ai , neopagans , agnostics , and atheists who volunteer in their communities . I &apos;m most certainly not a Christian and I volunteer . Do you actually know any non-Christians upon whom to base an opinion about which religious communities are and are not doing charity work ? It &apos;s a given fact the Christians . . . It &apos;s a given fact that the Christians make crap up and claim it &apos;s a given fact . For this we actually do have proof : creationism , for example.If tomorrow God came down and took all the the believers away . . .. . . it would do wonders for the economy . The rest of us will divvy up your property and take your old jobs.But that aside , if tommorrow all the Christians disappeared with their wrongheaded notions about how humanity is at the center of creation and is destined to &quot; rule &quot; the earth but is also somehow innately flawed because their god doesn &apos;t know how to make people properly , the world would tick along just fine , and I firmly believe that humanity would be far better off without that particular collective delusion. when something bad happens like 9 / 11So . . . the Christian god and Osama bin Laden sided together on the whole 9-11 thing . Doesn &apos;t that sorta suggest that your god has converted to Islam ? At any rate , it &apos;s pretty ludicrous to assert that if everybody just claps their hands and says &quot; I do believe in fairies &quot; loudly enough that your god will keep anything &quot; bad &quot; from ever happening . Bad things happen to pretty much everybody , Christian or otherwise . I would hope that your quest for faith would lead you to something with a little more depth than &quot; eek don &apos;t let anything bad get me . &quot; I mean , seriously , did you just put forth the argument that you worship a being who would blow up a building in a fit of pique because not enough people like him ? I realize your religious mythos includes Sodom and Gommorah and all that so perhaps it &apos;s not inconsistent , but honestly , your god sounds kinda like Timothy McVeigh there , bud . That &apos;s not praiseworthy , that &apos;s morally reprehensible.Your point there reminds me of a story an anthropology professor of mine used to tell.This professor lived and studied among the Karen people of Tibet , whose traditional religion is more or less a mix of polytheism and animism . One day some Christian missionaries happened along . The Karen don &apos;t prothelytize , so at first they listened politely to the missionaries and then told them it was nice that they were so excited about their god . Then the missionaries suggested that the Karen should worship their god too , and the Karen elders weren &apos;t so keen on that idea.So after much talk , one of the missionaries told the Karen elders a parable . &quot; There was a great boat on the ocean , and one man on it was a Christian ; and the boat was capsized and sank , but God saved the one Christian man . &quot; So the Karen elders told the missionaries that they wanted to talk among themselves about this parable for a bit , and they would come back with their answer at the end of the day.At the end of the day , after meeting together and discussing the Christian parable , the Karen elders called for the missionaries and told them : &quot; After discussing your story all day , we have decided that we are not impressed . We have considered the matter very thoroughly , and we are convinced that our gods could have saved all of the people on the boat . &quot;
think of a places in the world where there is no God Good grief . Find me a place on earth where there is no god or gods . Just because other parts of the world don &apos;t espouse your religion does not mean they do not espouse a religion . I myself am quite religious , although I doubt my faith has a terrific amount in common with yours.and you will only see death , poverty and despairBecause Latin America , which is very very Catholic , has none of the above ; whereas inexplicably , the non-Christian countries of Singapore , Brunei , Kuwait , Liechtenstein , and Qatar are all among the 10 highest per-capita GDPs.evolution is a farceNo , evolution is a very widely accepted scientific theory , and if science is incompatible with your religion then your religion is simpleminded . &quot; If science were ever found to contradict Buddhism , then Buddhism would have to change &quot; -- The Dalai Lamaprobably the number would be actually more because a lot of them are but are afraid of persecution from Church and State laws.AHAHAHAHAHAHA ! Wait , lemme -- AHAHAHAHAHA ! lemme catch my -- AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAA ! Did you REALLY just suggest that Christians do not found more charities because they are afraid of STATE PERSECUTION OF CHARITY ORGANIZATIONS ? AHAHAHAHAHAHAAA ... Damn , that &apos;s just funny.You have denial issuesNope . In fact , again , I am quite religious , and also quite committed to a scientific understanding of the universe . I just do not subscribe to YOUR beliefs .
Oh , yes , religious rights OTHER THAN YOURS are just bullcrap , yeah.NO , you CAN &apos;T interject religion into a school function -- but people do it all the time . U of TX regularly prays before football games and has a school motto invoking &quot; Gabriel &apos;s horn . &quot; At a state school . This too is just &quot; one case of many . &quot; And their actions are FAT illegal , but have they been &quot; persecuted &quot; for it ? NOOOO . If the church wants to hold a charity drive , great - pray away . If the public school wants to do it , then public prayer is inappropriate , because we have that whole disestablishmentarianism thing . Would you have been cool with it if it had been your kids at that function , and the teacher had said &quot; Let &apos;s make an offering to Ellegua &quot; or &quot; Here kids , ring these bells in honor of the generosity of Ishtar &quot; ? Or how about if the teachers stopped the activity so everybody could face Mecca and bow down and chant &quot; Allahu Akbar &quot; a few times ? You want religion in your kids &apos; school , then send your kids to a parochial school . That &apos;s what parochial schools are flippin &apos; for . But our public schools are not places for you to indoctrinate other people &apos;s children.Making Christians follow the law is not &quot; persecution . &quot; You guys just want &quot; special rights &quot; , e.g. , the right to inflict your religious beliefs and practices on the rest of us . And that , my friend , is persecution behavior .
I just get upset when it &apos;s completely away from it and someone tells.That &apos;s funny , I &apos;d think it was in general a good idea to encourage kids to &quot; tell &quot; when an adult in an authority position forces them to do something illegal and in violation of their rights.As far as the Texas thing I familiar with that being a part of the bible belt no one objectedOh , OK , since nobody objected to them breaking the law it &apos;s OK . But when somebody DOES object to the school breaking the law in Florida , then it &apos;s the objection that is not OK , whereas breaking the law should still be OK . That makes no sense whatsoever at all.it was only one person who complainedWell , that &apos;s not &quot; no one , &quot; then , is it ? That &apos;s someone whose civil rights were violated . Whereas those &quot; hundreds &quot; DO NOT HAVE A RIGHT TO FORCE PUBLIC PRAYER AT PUBLIC SCHOOLS . Their &quot; rights &quot; weren &apos;t violated one bit because the law explicitly says that they have no right to do that , whereas the complaining student does have a right to insist that they don &apos;t.where the wants and needs of the many out ways the needs of the fewThat &apos;s actually a principle of Star Trek , not government . The wants of the many do NOT in any case outweigh the rights of the few . That would be antithetical to our Constitution , and it &apos;s not what Spock meant either .
No , I &apos;m not confused . I think you &apos;re unclear on the law.If it was a school function , then it doesn &apos;t matter whether or not it was on school property ; the critical issue is whether it &apos;s school-sponsored.If it was not a school function , then there &apos;s no law being violated . If it is a school function , they &apos;ve got no business holding a prayer circle during it.Again I ask , would you be cool with it if your kids left the school campus for a charity drive and were then instructed to bow to Allah or chant Hare Krishna or spit rum and tobacco in honor of Ellegua ? I &apos;m betting the answer is &quot; no . &quot; Similarly , the Muslims , Hindus , Santeria et. al. aren &apos;t real keen on having their kids indoctrinated with foreign faiths.It is flat inappropriate to inject prayer into a public school function , on or off school grounds , period . Prayer is what our churches , temples , synagogues , mosques , and other places of worship are for . It is not what our public schools are for . Pray all you want on your own time -- in your house , on the street , at your place of worship , in your car , in the park . . . pick any event NOT sponsored by state authorities at any location NOT owned or operated by the state , and have at . ( Your example fails the first prong : a public school function is by definition &quot; sponsored by state authorities . &quot; ) But using the authority of the state to promote or enforce a religious belief is just plain illegal .
No , it &apos;s not an impediment to the First Amendment in any way , shape , or form . No one is being restrained from practicing or believing in their religion in any way . You just can &apos;t use the authority of the state to force your religion on other people . That is in fact what the First Amendment says . What on earth is so difficult about that to grasp ? Whether the students are on school property or off it is irrelevant . Whether the activity is school-sponsored or not is the critical issue . If your daughter gets raped on a field trip you can goddamn well still sue the school . If your son cracks his skull open during a school-sponsored extracurricular , you can damn well still sue the school . And if teachers start imposing prayer on students at a school-sponsored event , you can damn well still sue the school , because the school is responsible for a civil rights violation .
Well said your right about that no big what are points really .
nowhere except for a completely biased person would say that evolution has been provedAnd nowhere did anyone say that evolution has been &quot; proven . &quot; I said : &quot; evolution is a very widely accepted scientific theory . &quot; The &quot; debate &quot; over the validity of the theory is considered by science to be , well , I think the technical term is &quot; retarded . &quot; None of your points about evolution are vaguely even coherent . Of course mammals and other modern taxa evolved over hundreds of millions of years from much earlier sea-dwelling organisms . It &apos;s the &quot; hundreds of millions of years &quot; part that &apos;s crucial here , mate . And no , there &apos;s no reason that there would be more animals with higher-level thinking capabilities , although in fact there are good arguments to be made for a number of animals having varying degrees of &quot; reasoning &quot; power -- gorillas , chimps , elephants , big cats , and even parrots are quite bright compared to many other critters : bright enough to measure on &quot; our &quot; scale to the point where we &apos;ve seen higher-level thinking behaviors akin to our own in all of them ( examples include : use of sign language , use of sign language to communicate experiences that happenned prior to the acquition of sign language , primates teaching other primates to sign , the ability to identify one &apos;s own reflection as being one &apos;s own reflection , emotional expression , representational image-making . . . the list is really quite extensive ) . Also , dolphins are the only animal in the fossil record to have both more complex brains and a greater brain-to-body-size ratio than we do , and we really haven &apos;t a notion what they &apos;re up to with all that grey matter . But that &apos;s not really the point , since evolution functions so that better-adapted animals will , over time , reproduce more succesfully and , over greater amounts of time , diversify further . A shark doesn &apos;t need to be smart ; a shark is perfectly adapted to its environment . The evolution of brains is not baffling at all ; it &apos;s actually pretty well understood .
No , for real , we &apos;ve got a pretty decent handle on the brain.Check it : http : / / www.youramazingbrain.org / insidebrain / brainevolution.htm ( explained using small words ) http : / / faculty.ed.uiuc.edu / g-cziko / wm / 05.html ( explained using big words )
&quot; Is there a God ? &quot; is a metaphysical question that asks about the nature of reality . To paraphrase : &quot; Does a God exist as part of reality ? &quot; This is the WRONG question to be asking . We should be asking &quot; Is there any reason to believe in God ? &quot; . This is an epistemological question that relates to MAN &apos;S KNOWLEDGE concerning the nature of reality . I am open to the existence of a God , but only if I am presented with objective evidence that one exists ; evidence that cannot be explained more plausibly by another hypothesis . This view is common sense . Arbitrary assertions are not true until proven false , they are false until proven true . This is as true about the assertion &quot; God exists &quot; as it about the assertion &quot; invisible elephants live on Mars &quot; . The burden lies with those making the positive claim to prove it . Hence , theists must prove God exists , and until they do , I have no reason to believe in one . Of course , since faith is belief WITHOUT evidence , I &apos;m not even sure why theists WANT to prove that God exists . Proof would destroy faith . Evidence would turn faith into science , and would reduce God to an analyzable PART of the natural world , demoting him from his position as the supernatural Creator .
is it more likely that an animal with 10 fingers , 10 toes , a heart , a brain , fingernails , lungs , appendix , eyes etc - started eating some meat which was easier for digestion using less energy to process food allowing for better brain development leading to several branches of hominids ( homo sapiens , neanderthal , etc . ) and homo sapiens survived by adapting well to the changes that occurredoran all-knowing , all-seeing , all-powerful , all good , omnipresent yet invisible , 3-spirit single god breathed into dirt to make us in his image which just so happened to look a lot like that monkey and have 98.5 % of the same dna ?
if anything is not physical , then there must be a god ? i think you took a few leaps too many there. animals have fear etc and differring morals based on the changes their species has encountered over time thats exactly what evolution is &quot; no ones head gets bigger the more they know &quot; - a hard drive doesn &apos;t get any bigger as it stores more information either
People who need a god in order to feel they should follow the laws are literally sick in the mind , and they should be isolated from the rest of the world . They lack real , concrete morals and a decent understanding of the world . We should not feed this behavior , because if they ever snap , they become extremely dangerous.Instead of threatening people with the wrath of god and eternal hellfire , we should explain why love and understanding is important . We should explain to them that we are all in this together , and without empathy and caring ( the Russians played out a sick experiment to prove this one ) , we would die . We should explain that when you help someone , you have helped yourself . We should explain that pain and sweat are necessary to survive.Most importantly though , we should explain that the only part of them that will be left here when they die is what they did , and your actions are a mark on you for eternity , god or no god.Recently , I have begun to believe in a higher power again . I don &apos;t know what it is , but I do know this : What Jesus was trying to get people to see was the value of freedom . The power of numbers , the power of helping , the power of love , the power of caring , and why it matters . Most people see Jesus as an icon who was crucified for being &apos; too awesome &apos; or &apos; too great &apos; . They killed Jesus because he was trying to teach people what it means to care . I firmly believe that if there is a god , and he is the christian god , that he wants people to act with moral integrity for the love of the world . Not because there &apos;s a hell . People tend to get that twisted.Please for everyone , Kindness for Kindness sake , not for heaven or hell . Tread the noble path with noble intent , and you are truly a good person . Tread the noble path because you &apos;re afraid of being hurt , and you &apos;re a fucking coward.Whew , that &apos;s all I have to say about that .
CASE STUDY : Why it &apos;s impossible to have a meaningful debate about god with the indoctrinated.Sentence 1 : &quot; There are millions of people out there who are uneducated and I would say they are more likely to go to heaven than I am . &quot; Sentence 2 : &quot; This is purely an argument about God , regardless of what religion is brought in . Not religion , not religious texts , scriptures , rules etc . &quot; &quot; This class is classic behaviour of those within a cult . They can in one sentence make a broad statement reflecting specifically their religious beliefs as stated as fact with absolutely no supporting evidence at all , then in the next sentence accuse the one being debated of doing what the cult member just did , whether the original argument in any way reflected the response.It is odd behaviour to any outside of that person &apos;s mind . But to that person , it is nearly impossible to see the hypocrisy , and frankly the silliness of the statement .
If you truly believe that , you are a lost cause to the world . Take some time to reevaluate who and what you are . I don &apos;t care if you have a faith or not , but when you help someone , it should be because it &apos;s the right thing to do , not because the magic sky daddy will punish you if you don &apos;t do the right thing.If living for yourself is so easy , then do it . Prove to the world that without a god you have no moral fiber . Prove that you &apos;re just a sheep , and that &apos;s all you have the potential to ever be . And when they forge into the future , they will condemn your name , and the names everyone like you.Perhaps there is no god , but even so , life is a precious gift . If you feel like there &apos;s no reason to live it without a god , then you &apos;re fucking useless . You have ignored Jesus &apos; message . I wish you luck .
You should take some time to walk through a cemetery and if you get a chance to see a fresh dug grave , stare at it for a while because that my friend is your destiny.wow ... that was sooooo deep , I &apos;ve never thought of death , I mean obviously that &apos;s why I &apos;m atheist ... LMAO . Sorry , couldn &apos;t say that with a straight face.True , we all die . But an atheist accepts that truth , and the religious live in perpetual denial .
I &apos;m constantly amazed by people who cannot pick-up on sarcasm.You &apos;re point was that walking through a cemetery would somehow make one believe in god , which is an excellent point actually , as fear of death is probably when all is said and done , the number one reason people buy into religion - even more so than indoctrination.However , I was joking . Everyone thinks of death , even atheists . It &apos;s not as if people who don &apos;t believe in an afterlife aren &apos;t aware that death is immanent.Everyone knows , old news at this point . Walking through a cemetery is nothing but a pretty picture and self-validation for those who have chosen to believe in a myth out of fear.I &apos;m an atheist because 1 . If there were a god it would be much more obvious . I mean ... why the mystery ? come on now , 82 % of the world population believes in him in one form or another , you can &apos;t get that many humans to believe in anything . So what &apos;s with all the hiding ? 2 . It doesn &apos;t make sense . It makes far more sense from observation that humans are a happy mistake ( for humans ) and nothing more . All science shows pretty conclusively that life was inevitable on this planet , and likely many more considering the numbers involved . So no creator is necessary . 3 . From my experience , religious people act as if they &apos;re the victims of some mass hysteria , therefore without further proof available , I must assume they are victims of some form of mass hysteria .
you should because if you don &apos;t the rest of us might put you in prison or a mental institution.Without God what then is the moral imperative ? What then is the &quot; ought &quot; to ? - see reply to moral grounding
I don &apos;t remember saying there shouldn &apos;t be some sort of authority . I honestly think you &apos;re construing my words insanely though . So I &apos;ll say this as simply as possible : If there is a god , and he is truly the Christian God , then he would not want people to be afraid of him or do the right thing just because he exists and is there.My whole point is , you should be a good person because being a good person is the right thing to do , not because your religion says it or because your belief dictates you should . You should just be a good person.You don &apos;t need a god to have the ability to be a responsible , loving , and caring person . If you think that , you &apos;re lost . I understand everything you are saying perfectly . You do not understand me .
Yes , that is what I label myself . I am a fairly devout Christian ( Episcopalian ) that attends church regularly and prays often . However , I cannot , and nobody can , say with 100 % certainty that there does exist a God / Gods , thus I do have what you would call a little bit of doubt as well . We all do , we &apos;re being dishonest with ourselves if we say we don &apos;t . Here &apos;s what I DO NOT believe : earth is 6,000 years old . I don &apos;t see how ANYONE can believe that nonsense . The watchmaker argument . Pretty much anything put out by CSE and that tax-evading conman Kent Hovind is to be disregarded as utter bogus .
People allowed to think for themselves are able to think more clearly about tolerance towards others , compassion , and the common good more than religious people who are only taught to follow without questioning . The only reason why we haven &apos;t been able to &quot; figure it out &quot; is because we keep on hammering the issue of god through religion over and over and over and over .... Religion is present in every sphere and it makes it difficult for those who want to talk about god-less morality , as they are shunned as if it was something impossible . What do you think of a god-less morality ?
Well first , since you are the one talking about a greater good , it would be nice to start with a definition or examples of a greater good . In my conception of a greater good I am assuming this means to uphold certain values , such as truthfulness , and thus I put this as an example . Sorry if that was not clear , perhaps you can clarify , what the greater good is and how we can identify what it is . Also , when you say that we shouldn &apos;t bring religion into the debate you must first explain why on your introduction to the debate you have us imagine that we are creating a religion . We should first agree on whether or not religion is an obligatory vehicle for a belief in God . It seems to me that in your argument followers of a god want to find ways to please this god , and thus will be compelled to follow rules . People can either then follow established religions or create personal &quot; guidelines &quot; and &quot; rules &quot; of their own , and this becomes their religion . What benefit can there be to society where people are creating their own guidelines to follow based on a subjective understanding of a God ? Some people may say my god requires me to dance naked in the middle of the street and then ... what is the benefit to society ? Either way , as you say , without bringing religion into the question ( or pretending to create a religion ) , there are many people out there , agnostics for example , who do believe in a creator but not necessarily some creator who wants anything from them ... a god that is more of a passive uninvolved observer , than a ruler . These people thus , have no need to &quot; please &quot; him or follow &quot; his &quot; rules . And it doesnt mean that they people are lawless savages . The ability to understand what is good and bad for society , as I have mentioned before , has nothing to do with the belief in having a god to please or fear . A lot of people claim to believe in the possibility of a god , and yet not be religious , since the god they contemplate is one who doesn &apos;t provide systematized rules . The systematized rules that you mention , come from religion , NOT a belief in god . May I ask you why you believe that people are not able to figure things out on their own ? You say that religion should not take the blame for a lot of the ills in society , but look how far religion has come and yet it doesn &apos;t seem we are learning how to get along . Maybe it is time to let people figure things out , and see what happens instead of getting stuck in the idea that people need some mythical being to tell them what to do .
The basis of my argument is that God &apos;s word ( whatever religion it is you are talking about ) impedes our ability to reason about the consequences and impacts of our choices / actions . Any formalized set of rules does this when people are told to follow without questioning because something is supposed to be &quot; good &quot; . Cases come up over and over again in everyday life , not just in difficult cases like abortion , euthanasia , cloning , where we confront the fact that reality is NOT black and white . But god &apos;s word and formalized rules want to simplify reality for us and this is where they fail . You should watch this ted talk about the ability to solve problems v.s. the ability to follow rules . Claiming to &quot; know the answer &quot; is the characteristic of zealous religious people , who believe that a rule given by god is THE only answer . The scientific reasoning is precisely to question those things that may seem as &quot; absolutes &quot; . Regarding knowledge or education it would be absurd to say that we now know less things about the world than we did in the past . So , in the past - in the midst of more ignorance , it made sense to believe that if you don &apos;t worship a certain way god will get angry and stop the rain and your crops will die ; but now , such a simple minded reason behind the need to behave well would not be accepted as we know more about how the world works . In this sense , we have more information needed to make decisions . I don &apos;t think it is necessary to think about difficult or modern day examples ( cloning , abortion , euthanasia ) and figure out how to apply religion to it . In every day decisions we are always forced to &quot; bend &quot; the words in the book because they can &apos;t provide answers . Then people argue that it is their own &quot; personal &quot; relationship to god what matters -- it would seem as if everyone has a different conception of God anyway , these words are then subjective and left to interpretation . No one is adhering to the words strictly because the words are too narrow . The world is not black and white . Teaching ethics and moral behavior requires a lot more than making people behave like sheep .
I think again , to dispute the assumption that im saying people now are smarter than before is wrong . Im saying people now have more information than before , and more information leads to better choices . Of course egyptian , mayan , and chinese civilizations developed at an amazing rate and with surprising quality for our standards . But the eqyptians were also burying their dead in huge tombs ( the pyiramids ) and along with exhorbitant amounts of gold , why ? because their belief in gods entailed a belief in an afterlife . I think they could have spent their resources and time building other structures that would have helped their community , rather than tombs . ( though now we admire them just for cultural value ) . So it is these kind of behavior that I argue stems from a lack of knowledge about the world and how it works . However it doesn &apos;t mean we are &quot; smarter &quot; now . Since there are religious believers who continue behaving in the same supersticious ways ... When they get sick they pray instead of going to the doctor , etc . But these behavior now should be inexcusable because now we have more knowledge about the world , so it is more like a choice . Back in the time of the Mayans , it may be more acceptable for them to come up with rituals to call for the rain , since they dont have the scientific knowledge about what makes rain fall . But now , when people engage in the same kind of things , it just makes no sense at all because there is more knowledge out there about how things really work . As far as morality goes , I actually think that something like the hamurabi code where the crime was punished in direct retribution , was quite innovative and logical and we could benefit from it . If you steal , we will cut off your hand . End of story . No need for god to induce people to act morally . ; ) Just a good execution of the law . Of course this is not the ideal ... and again , things are never just &quot; black and white &quot; , so in the end it may not work in our day . The ideal would be for us to think critically about our actions . To have an awareness about the common good . We dont need an image of &quot; god &quot; in this , just as we dont need a hamurabi code . We need something more complex .... a reform in the educational system for example ... Belief in non-abrahamic gods for the greater good. hmmm. that makes this more interesting , but still based on my argument above , you can deduce that the image of god is unnecessary . We all have an understanding of god that is different from each other . And there is no way of proving which god is right . Groups of people , cults , have come up with new &quot; gods &quot; and then followers are so blind that they end up committing crazy things in the name of these gods . Think mass suicides . This is the problem with the concept of &quot; god &quot; ... any god , impedes rational thinking .
Regarding the cults , the reason why I find them relevant is because followers of the abrahamic religions dismiss them as being completely &quot; crazy &quot; when in my opinion , the abrahamic religions in themselves are as deranged as cults . So I find them relevant because it shows what happens when people try to say that they have access to &quot; god &quot; or can possibly know his / her mind . There are people out there who still believe in talking snakes ... I admit your point in saying we can never know &quot; everything &quot; , but you must admit that when you make a desicion , even as simple as buying a new computer , you do research and try to find out as much as you can so that you will be better equipped for making a decision . It &apos;s as simple as that ... we become more educated so we can make better decisions . Which leads to the final point ... religious people do not do things just to please god , but because they also think it &apos;s the right way of living . I think we are all entitled to the same freedom religious people want of choosing the best way of living if this behavior is not going to harm anyone else . I &apos;ve never come across any scientific evidence as to why sodomy is bad for you . Therefore , I have no basis for saying it is &quot; bad &quot; . Why is it bad ? If you point out something in science , then you will agree that we need education , scientific facts , to help us make desicions that are not bad for us . But if you just &quot; think &quot; it is bad for no reason at all ... then it makes no sense . I dont understand your argument about being part lion part tiger . A girl of 12 consenting to sex with a 90 year old ... i think if we continue with this god bullshit , children CAN be brainwashed into doing things without questioning them . Have you watched the videos about Jesus Camp ? It is very close to the same brainwashing that cult leaders do ... and you know what makes it so wrong ? that it is targetted at children , who are suceptible . Just as a girl of 12 , we both would agree , has not reached the age of consent to have sex ; the children from jesus camp also have not reached the age of consent to accept or reject ideas independently. why ? because they have not been exposed to more information about the world. how can god be for the greater good when it inhibits our ability to decide for ourselves ? About drugs . I believe they are bad because Ive read enough about their effects on the body . Thus I can say they are bad , there is evidence . But saying things are bad just because of some intuition about god , is just plain ignorance .
No , it &apos;s not for the greater good . I think that whether people worship an idle or no they are going to act in such a way as they &apos;re nature and experience determined.Religion is simply something used as kind of a scapegoat . As an example ; if the commandments were handed down in the way the old testament proclaims they were , amidst all kinds of shenanigans , I firmly believe the addition of a god would not have been a necessity , that even they as wild as the book claims them to be , would have wrapped their heads around acting in such a way was self-destructive , without the introduction of some god . ( For the record , most likely none of that happened , and it is simply a variation on similar stories found from the older version , the Egyptian Book of the Dead , but it serves as an example ) It would seem on the surface to many atheists then , that religion at worse is simply a no-lose , no-gain thing people do.I disagree . I think while many aspects of religion , indeed most , encourage good behaviour , I believe taking the easy-out of describing to the religious masses that the reason this optimal behaviour is desirable as &quot; uh , uh , because god said so &quot; encourages stupidity and a lack of reflection , which while in many cases leads to a group of people who act properly in society , at the same time makes it really easy to get them to do ridiculous things like blow up buildings in the name of allah , or crusade against the middle east in the name of god.Thinking people do not act in such a way . I think one who doesn &apos;t believe in a god is more likely thinking about these kinds of moral dilemmas instead of simply following some prophet &apos;s imagined wishes .
A &quot; cult &quot; in the ancient world was simply a religion devoted to the worship of one deity or deities from a broader pantheon -- a religious practice or &quot; veneration &quot; . &quot; Cults &quot; in the ancient world were more like the ordinary , run-of-the-mill religions of today ; referring to an ancient cult doesn &apos;t really correspond to the modern-day usage of &quot; cult &quot; at all . I wouldn &apos;t dismiss the religions of antiquity so lightly .
I think you make a fine point in saying that uniting behind a common religion will bring about more peace than allowing divided opinions , and I also appreciate you referencing Green Street Hooligans . I thought that was a wonderful movie and you tied it into your argument nicely so I marked you up a point for it.To clarify my argument , I understand that eliminating religious beliefs will not be the end-all solution to the world &apos;s problems , and that people will always fight and try to control one another , however I see religion as simply another tool or motivation to fight . I believe that eliminating religion from the list of things to fight over could only help.To address what you said about uniting behind a common &quot; god &quot; : I believe that it is natural for humans to have differences , and that society must find a way to embrace those differences instead of repressing them with religion ( or other forms of absolute unity such as authoritarian government , etc . ) It may sound nice to have everyone united in feeling and acting the same way , but it is simply not human nature to do so , and history shows that these sorts of feelings only breed more intolerance toward those who don &apos;t fall in line . The sort of logic you are arguing for is the same sort that Hitler would have used to explain himself . That society would be better if we all just felt the same way towards everything , and that we were all united behind a common government ( or religion in this case ) . The point I &apos;m trying to make is that people are different . Their moods and opinions are always changing , and the way to cope with this not by eliminating diversity , but finding a way to embrace it ( i.e : democracy )
So if everyone gets to worship whatever religion feel like , doesn &apos;t that negate your point of uniting behind a common religion ? What you are saying here basically agrees with what I said about people having freedom to believe whatever they want . If there is no common religion , then there is no single religion to unite behind and therefore no point to religion as a unifier or peacekeeping tool .
you should try talking to the flying speghetti monster and he may reveal himself - if it is within 10 minutes of the 3rd new moon of the pasta year
Ive tried to talk to &quot; god , &quot; and he fails to make himself real to me in much the same way he fails to make himself real to the 4000 Africans who starve to death every day . When &quot; god &quot; shows to me that he can feed those starving people , or fix the economy , or do something that has a real impact besides making me feel better for a little bit , I &apos;ll start believing . Until then &quot; god &quot; can &apos;t do anymore for me than heroin can . I can feel euphoria for half an hour , but at the end of the day nothing has changed .
Religion has always been a point of argument for human beings . Sometimes , even leading to war , such was the case with the Crusades . What is the point of arguing about something that we &apos;re not sure is even there ? Sure it may be a strong belief , but why must you live your life by a two thousand year old book ? The Bible is outdated . It is two thousand years old and over a billion people live their life according to the standards set forth in said book . Books should always have more editions , especially for one that hasn &apos;t gone out of print for the last two millenia . It doesn &apos;t tackle issues like healthcare , the environment or a democracy . Even if it does , it barely goes into any detail . What I &apos;m trying to say , is that people should stop fighting over and discriminating each other according to what religion they are , but to instead , respect each other for out own , independent character , not by what outdated book they like to read .
This is a cop out of the old question to whether god exists or not . If you want your history books forged and you ability to think for yourself stripped of you , I suggest moving to North Korea . Would believing in Santa Claus your whole life make you a better person , what a stupid proposition . Kids don &apos;t start stealing and killing when they find out Santa Claus isn &apos;t real . The only surprising part is a child can easily fathom Santa not existing , yet grown adults can &apos;t do the same with god . Imagine if a child demanded proof that Santa didn &apos;t exist , and claimed that it is better to just believe in him ... no i bet you can &apos;t imagine such a stupid child ... only adults seem to be able to defend such an idiotic concept .
Everything works the way it would if there was no god , therefore there &apos;s no reason to believe there is a god . Just like there &apos;s no reason to believe in Zeus or apollo .... Etc Whether it is for the greater good ( which it &apos;s not ) is erroneus . Should people believe in Santa their whole lives , would it be for the greater good ... who gives a shit , and no , I don &apos;t need a fake story to help me behave . We &apos;ve spent long enough listening to these people , lets try and seek actual truth , rather than live in a fairy land .
Why does life have to have an absolute meaning ? I ingrain meaning into my life through those around me and my actions , not the hope that once I die there will be another chance at living a life that I &apos;m already currently living.This life is perfectly good enough for me , thanks . Once I die , I &apos;m gone , and knowing that makes the life I have now even more special .
I don &apos;t know if life is created from some god or if I &apos;m just a random spawn of the universe , but life is a gift either way . The only meaning life has is the meaning you give it . Before you die , accomplish that meaning . We &apos;re born , we live , we die . The beginning and the end don &apos;t matter . It &apos;s the middle that makes life beautiful .
Don &apos;t you think it &apos;s a little more in line with Occam &apos;s Razor to live life for its own sake rather than the POSSIBILITY that there is something after ? You sound like one of those people who watch the scoreboard more than the game itself .
Nope , You can &apos;t use an arguement I had not yet posted as the reasons for your previous arguement.I understand you don &apos;t believe that Jesus is great.I want to know what about that is illogical though.Do you see the difference ? You can not believe something that is logical , understand ? I can not believe the sky is blue if I want . That doesn &apos;t mean the sky being blue is &quot; illogical . &quot; So , let &apos;s have a logic debate instead of a feeling debate . I want to know what about &quot; Jesus is great , but not god , &quot; is &quot; illogical . &quot; That , or admit it &apos;s logical , and you just don &apos;t believe it ...
er , I realize that I &apos;ve been down voted to nearly oblivion in this debate , but it &apos;s certainly is not for a lack of a good arguememt.The point is not that a blind man must rely on others to tell him the sky is blue . Or that the analogy of the blind mind is innaccurate , because it &apos;s a matter of everyone being blind , not just the one man.The point is , that if one even excepts that Jesus was ever alive , then there is nothing illogical about this person having been &quot; great &quot; but not the son of God . Messenger is assuming so much it boggles the mind , but one of the things specific to this arguement that he / she is assuming , is that Jesus at some time said he was the son of god . Ignoring that there &apos;s no evidence this person ever existed . Ignoring that there &apos;s no evidence that he is the son of god.There is no evidence he ever claimed to be the son of god.So , you have a statement , &quot; Jesus was a great man , but not the son of god . &quot; This statement is assuming he existed . Which is debatable . And then assuming that he never claimed to be the son of god . Which is debatable . And then it assumes he was great , which of course giving the debatable nature of the subject , is debatable.Now , Messenger , by his / her near retarded statement - skips over every step of logic a third grader would accidently use , and goes straight to &quot; Jesus did say he was the son of god , ( ignoring whether he ever lived , and whether he ever said that ) and therefore , he either must be the son of god , or he was crazy for saying it ( even though he may or may not have said it , and may or may not have existed ) therefore , he could not have said it and not been the son of god and be a great man . &quot; So , according to Messenger &apos;s infintile logic , Jesus is either the son of god , or a crazy person.Nothing in between.Which like so much of Messenger &apos;s insane rantings , is completely insane.Given that there is 0 evidence of anything , every option is just as &quot; logical &quot; as the next.I was making fun of him / her , attempting to use logic to support an inherently and obviously illogical arguement .
Welcome back ... I can now explain the avalanche of downvotes I received earlier today . At least you &apos;re responding to this argument.Other than the Bible , what evidence is there that Christianity is the &quot; right &quot; religion ? And since when is the Bible a historical book ? There is no historical evidence of Jesus existing , therefore Christianity must be based completely on faith ( as it is with most religions ) . In addition , I &apos;m curious to hear what evidence you claim backs up the Bible . As for reason ... well as I said I &apos;m very interested to hear this.As for your simplistic descriptions of the world &apos;s religions , I find myself in an unusual position ... arguing with a theist about the legitimacy of religion , from the point of view of religion . You clearly feel a very personal connection with your own God , however , you deny that that same feeling can exist for anyone else . Can a Hindu not feel passion for his Gods ? Is the love he feels for his Gods false ? You claim that missionaries spread the word of God to nearly all cultures , but what about before that ? What about the Native Americans who existed before the European conquerors ? Were they sentenced to eternal damnation because of their ignorance ? How about when the missionaries brought smallpox ? Was this God &apos;s love ? You also seem to talk about Christianity as if it &apos;s a single religion . How about all the different sects of Christianity ? Methodists , Baptists , Mormons , Catholics , Quakers .... which is the right one ? Are they all right ? You seem to think that religion makes most people moral as well . Do not forget that segregation lasted longest in the &quot; Bible Belt , &quot; or that the KKK touts Christianity as one of it &apos;s principles . Or how about the group &quot; God hates fags &quot; ? Those guys are religious , and clearly assholes.Your view of the world is simplistic , and leaves very little room for other cultures and religions . From listening to your arguments , one can clearly see that why religion , when in the hands of those with closed minds , has been such a divisive force throughout history .
Welcome back ... I can now explain the avalanche of downvotes I received earlier todaylmao , I never ran into messenger , but oddly today I had three very old religious arguements down voted with 0 rebuttal . Messenger , or someone , works in mysterious ways ...
Incorrect . There is no contemporary source that can be sited referencing Jesus even though there were many contemporary historians at the time .
Hey check out this link , I don &apos;t know if this will mean anything to you but my religion ( the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints ) answers all of those questions you asked . Please don &apos;t make fun of it , don &apos;t ask me if I &apos;m joking , try to look at it with an open mind .
It is not blaming God ... it is just postulating that if a deity existed with the qualities usually associated with God then why would things happen as they do ?
Come on , do you really think that if there is a god who watches over us , they will just stand by and let us suffer ? Yes , I know that some things are our fault , but bad things happen to innocent people . If God is heartless enough to let someone get raped or murdered and not do anything about it , I wouldn &apos;t want to worship him anyway .
Love in a real sense doesn &apos;t exist . It is something in our heads . I revel and delight in it , yes , but this doesn &apos;t mean there is an objective source for love . Are two corpses who were married in life still in love ? You also give your own arguement away by argueing love because , like love , god is in our heads too and while the idea is very real in the sense that it affects reality through the actions of people there is nothing substantial to back any of it up . Saying god told you to hug a tree for the rest of your life holds the same weight as if you said I love this tree therefore I have to hug it for the rest of my life . The differnce is love is innate and the idea of god has to be taught and indoctrinated .
Perhaps believing just for the benefits is a sin all on it &apos;s own . Should then , you be rewarded for your faith ? The key to the kingdom of heaven cannot be obtained should it be coveted .
I can only hope that if there is a God , he judges you on the ethics of your actions , not on whether you join his creepy , misguided cult . Plus , good non-believers are more moral in principle than those who are good only for the threat of punishment .
I &apos;m sorry , your scripture is incompatible with logical arguments .
You know , most societies would consider that kind of ranting a sure sign of schizophrenia ... Anyway , I &apos;ll have you know that no one has any need of a &quot; God &quot; Because he doesn &apos;t exist.And even if he does , no one has seen or heard anything from him , so we &apos;re kinda getting along fine without him anyway.Unless you think you go around talking to him , and he talks to you , In which case , yeah , you definitely have schizophrenia .
Actually , 84 % of the world is crazy , since only 16 % are not religious - in the world that is.And no one is &quot; rending &quot; you , just laughing.And who talks to themselves on a social networking site ? &quot; Must , must get this through my head ... &quot; Just curious , do you think Jesus is reading what you write ? And judging you on it or something ? Like , are you trying to score brownie points with all the quotes , to show how much you love Jesus ? Because as far as actually debating , continually quoting from a book the person your debating thinks is rubish , isn &apos;t very effective .
Well , first , to answer your question : Yes , believing in God is worth it . But you must know , that faith in God does not mean that you are perfect , or that you will be considered &quot; good &quot; by people ( in fact , many will despise you and call you intolerant out of their intolerance ) , or that your life will somehow be void of suffering or the traps of sin and temptations of life . It &apos;s not easy sometimes , but is most definitely worth it.So basically the only difference is in your head ... The benefits are : You are adopted into the family of God and our now considered His child . How awesome is that ? ! It &apos;s not , at all , seems kinda lame actually . Do you have any solid examples of actual things that make it &quot; awsome ? &quot; Secondly , by accepting His son as our Savior we are instilled with the Holy Spirit , which then guides us when we don &apos;t know what to do , convicts us when we &apos;re wrong so we will know truth from lies , and transforms us to be the kind of person we all really want to be but could never seem to do or be on our own , like His son , Jesus.Hm , interesting , this holy spirit you are instilled with , is there some way to measure this ? Or is it just in your head again ? And &quot; like His son , Jesus , &quot; so what , I get nailed to a cross , tortured , killed , and millions after me will die in my name , and people will kill people who don &apos;t believe in me ? SWEET ! Where do I sign up . ( that &apos;s sarcasm ) Oh and I forgot a biggie : we get to live eternally with Him and Jesus and all the other saints in Heaven after we pass ! Yeah ? Pretending for a second that this wacky fairy tale is true , what the hell is so cool about living for eternity with a bunch of people that never did anything fun ever ? Like , what do you do all day ? Sounds retarded to me . No thanks .
Hm ... You already said that.Does that mean you give up ? You should pray for an answer to counter my arguements , instead of just quoting scripture.Or you could do some research , and come up with valid reasons I &apos;m wrong . ( by the way , your last two arguements are tagged as &quot; no its not &quot; god would not be too happy about that ... )
Why do people continue to bring up Pascal &apos;s Wager ? Firstly , it completely ignores the fact that there is an infinite set of possibile gods , and therefore the chance of you believing in the right one is infinitesimally small.Secondly , it doesn &apos;t explore the possibility that the god that does exist either doesn &apos;t want you to believe in him , or punishes people who believed in the wrong god more than he does people who simply didn &apos;t believe in any god.Thirdly , it assumes that god is an idiot and can &apos;t tell the difference between people who actually believe , and people who are believing just incase.Living by Pascal &apos;s Wager is a foolish way to live .
1 ) Why do you have faith ? 2 ) What does &quot; universal entity &quot; mean ? 3 ) What makes you propose that god is an entity that - in and of itself - compels goodness ?
Agreed on the Pascal &apos;s Wager argument . I would also like to add that if there isn &apos;t anything in this life after , than you have wasted your one and only life in fear of some spooky invisible being . That right there is the biggest loss .
I don &apos;t accept your dichotomy .
I WAS LOST AND NOW I AM FOUND ( what sense does it make ) this is utter foolishness that god saved you or brought you back .............
Why is it better to believe &quot; in something &quot; ( what does that even mean ? ) than not believe &quot; in something &quot; ?
You wasted life , why wouldn &apos;t you waste the afterlife ? - Modest MouseThat pretty much sums up my opinion of the whole thing .
As I start my doctoral program in biomathematics , I discover that there is absolutely no room for a deity in the advancement of human intellect , science , and mathematics . There is not enough evidence to suggest a deity , therefore the null hypothesis of there not existing one is not rejected if you follow the laws of statistics properly .
no why would one waste the time an effort worrying about god live life here and now if a god exists you will know soon enough , and if one does exist i would imagine he just laughs at organized religion
No , for very simple reasons.There is no requirement for the intervention of a God to live a healthy lifestyle . We &apos;re capable of making our own decisions without knowing where life comes from , when and how the universe began , etc . And religions like Christianity attempt to reach into the realms of the unknown and not only fill this gap with definite answers , but it tells you not to do this or that and creates antagonistic behavior towards people like homosexuals , sexually active people , and people who drink or smoke pot . In other words , victimless crimes . Then it takes credit for basically the entire universe and people &apos;s natural tendency to grow and prosper . I don &apos;t see the benefit of following a cult that claims to know the intentions of an almighty creator.The atheistic countries of Europe have already worked this out amongst themselves . It took centuries of religious persecution and violence to create countries with the foremost standards of living , without religion . I live without it too , I don &apos;t hurt anybody , I help out , and any culture knows that the best way to approach life is to live happy and help others live happy . No commandments required .
It &apos;s not worth it , believe in yourself not so much of god.God can &apos;t help you , he can only guide you .
Why is it when ever meaning of god comes up everyone assumes it is god , father of jesus .... theres more to life then christians ... and the bible is incomplete for all u uneducated christians out there who refuse to beleive the truth about the hundreds of yrs , and to date , of lies deception and propaganda supplied to them
Though i like to see some films or read some stories about the god , but i really think the god does not exist unless i become the richest person tomorrow for my praying , LOL ~ ~ ~ ~ / &gt;
God is dead , and we killed him .
I dont care to explain myself here , but God does not exist for many reasons and those who believe that he does are either ignorant of science or arrogant enough to not accept facts .
God doesnt exist ! ! Everything is caused by the big bang theory ! ! ! ! We are evolved from sea monkeys so there are isnt such thing in god maybe budda real but not god and the dalama lama is real and the hopes real but there is no such thing as a god . I believe there was such a person as jesus ! ! ! ! !
God does not exist . We can agree that things that have no proof of existence does not exist in a physical matter . We should not hold god to a different standard . There simply isn &apos;t any physical evidence of his existence therefore he does not exist .
There is no proof for the existance of God . / And you cannot prove a negative . / &gt; And given that the burden of proof lies with the person claiming something , we shouldn &apos;t have to prove anything . / &gt; Logical reason is : / &gt; Person 1 : &quot; I have a baseball &quot; / &gt; Person 2 : &quot; Prove it &quot; / &gt; Person 1 pulls out a baseball and thus proves himself . / &gt; Person 2 : &quot; Awesome , let &apos;s go play catch &quot; / &gt; / &gt; Religious reason / &gt; Person 1 : &quot; I have a baseball &quot; / &gt; Person 2 : &quot; Prove it &quot; / &gt; Person 1 : &quot; You can &apos;t prove I don &apos;t &quot; / &gt; Person 2 walks away because that argument is nowhere near substantial . / &gt; It &apos;s as substantial as eating a seed . / &gt; A single seed . / &gt; Neither are substanital .
So much around us is proof that there is no god . If there was a god , why would hitler have killed all the jews ? AND WHY DID MY DOG DIE !
There is no personal creator God who cares if you are &apos; sinning &apos; and wants to send you to hell . That &apos;s fantasy . I can &apos;t say with absolute certainty that there is not a superior power that may have created the universe . It &apos;s one really easy explanation to explain where all this came from , and life itself . It &apos;s not based on anything more than a hunch though , and it comforts people . Plus ... Where the heck is God if he does exist ? So ... I &apos;m about 99 % sure there is no God . Science and reason show us how things work in the world , and nothing that has happened required a creator or God to make it happen . Rather than ask how can the universe seem to come from nothing ( common misconception ) , ask yourself how a supreme all-knowing force can just exist , where does that come from ? Oh of course ... God doesn &apos;t need an origin , does he ? It &apos;s a simple way to fill in gaps in our knowledge without using our brains so much , to say that God just made it all . The evidence for God not existing is much greater than the evidence of his existence .
Although I never really was religious to begin with , in recent years I began to lean towards a sort of skeptical agnosticism . However , if pressed to choose a side , I would certainly consider myself a basic atheist . I really don &apos;t believe in God in the traditional sense-I don &apos;t believe that God is an old bearded guy sitting on a cloud that can poof a donkey ( for example ) into existence . I just feel as if there is less and less reason for me to buy into the snake oil that organized religions try to sell me . I feel very good about my beliefs ( or lack thereof ) -they feel right to me . However , I am not the stereotypical depressed , bitter atheist that you may see in your mind &apos;s eye-far from it , in fact . There are so many other good things to believe in , what should keep me from getting up in the morning ?
There &apos;s the odd thought of &quot; what if ? &quot; but nobody &apos;s given me any proof . I have just as much evidence that the universe is actually a toilet . / &gt; / &gt; @ Homestar : That &apos;s completely incorrect . For example , I could reason that Bob is a robot , because I &apos;ve never seen him eat or sleep . Or , I could lop off his arm , noting the flesh , blood , and bone inside , proving him to be human . Which is more convincing ?
Yes , i find it really hard to buy into the whole religion bullcrap . If God does exist , than who created him ?
There is no solid proof that god exists , Therefore until proven he does , He doesn &apos;t . / / &gt; Remember , &apos; Innocent until &apos; Proven &apos; Guilt . &apos;
Well when you get right down to it ... No . If he did exist then why doesn &apos;t he do something about the global financial crisis and terrorism ?
I agree if god truly existed then we would have more resources and we would have more help
Keep in mind that &quot; good &quot; and &quot; not-good &quot; - I reject the notion of &quot; evil &quot; - are completely context dependent . There is no &quot; good &quot; or &quot; not-good &quot; without point of view . The suggestion that anything is &quot; good &quot; or &quot; not-good &quot; inherently outside of point of view is the same mistaken suggestion that there is meaning or purpose behind all . The fact is , the meaning of a thing is individually determined . Without point of view , there is no meaning.Meaning and the word &quot; meaning &quot; are human invention.One must and can only act from one &apos;s own point of view in specific context . The &quot; good &quot; can be anything . The &quot; not-good &quot; can be anything . You must answer why it is &quot; good &quot; or &quot; not-good &quot; and to whom - every time .
roy 1167 writes &quot; It would be extremely difficult to definitively prove that human life actually derived from another species , and simply seeing some evidence is not definitive proof . &quot; In fact , the case for our close kinship with the other apes is absurdly strong . In principle , one can doubt any factual claim , which is why the law distinguishes between any doubt whatsoever and reasonable doubt . There is no reasonable doubt about the matter . Even in the 19th Century , it was pretty clear on the basis of the visible anatomy of the higher primates that human beings were very similar to chimpanzees and gorillas ; but fossil evidence was scanty . That &apos;s no longer true--the missing link hasn &apos;t been missing from some time now--but even more importantly , modern molecular biology has demonstrated how our genome matches up with that of other primates in a way that would be inexplicable were we not related . I &apos;m reminded of an old joke . The worried husband hires a private eye to check up on his wife . The detective reports back with bad news : &quot; I watched your place last night . A very handsome guy showed up and they went off in a taxi to a night club where they danced cheek to cheek and had several drinks . Then they took another taxi . I could see them making out in the back seat . After they got to his place , they had another drink and started petting on the sofa . Your wife took off her dress and the guy pulled down his pants . After she was stark naked , he picked her up and carried her into the bedroom . &quot; &quot; And then what happened . &quot; sez the husband . &quot; The lights went out and I couldn &apos;t see . &quot; &quot; Always the lingering doubt ! &quot;
You argue , as do many theists , that human ignorance about the development of life , the nature of life , or any other aspect of reality , constitutes proof that a god must to explain that which is otherwise unexplained . This is the worst and most desperate kind of argument . Just because something is unexplained does NOT mean that it is inexplicable . It only means that it is NOT YET explained . Human intellectual history is nothing if not a consistent set of evidence that , given time , ANYTHING is explicable by the power of the rational human mind . Remember , the sun , moon , and the Nile river used to be considered gods because no other explanation was evident . Those gods DIED when science explained them . So it will be with the Judeo-Christian-Muslim god , as well as all others , when the light of human intellect exposes the shadows that your religions require in order to thrive . For 5000 years the human mind has been narrowing the realm in which your gods can exist . And every day that realm gets smaller . Stop fighting it . Reject fear as the basis for fundamental beliefs , and join us to promote the light of reason and the grandeur of humanity .
You say we are ignorant , but I think it is you . There is no evidence of god for us to be ignorant of . On the other hand , there is plenty of evidence that leads us to question his / her / it &apos;s existence . You should go to school , read a few books , and start questioning life and your belief system . There &apos;s no reason to feel sorry for those of us who &apos;s minds are free from the shackles of blind faith and ignorance .
How can u critizes people who take scientific proof and reason to why the world was created . Religion is ignorant . If a super natural being created the universe than how was he ( God ) created . Even the big bang theory gives more rational evidence than the bible . Earth being created and sustaining water and land , creating a moon , and such all have factual evidence in HOW it was done . And yes the human race has been striving to X out god , and they have been succesful . They &apos;ve X &apos;ed out many things that the church once believed . It is only a matter of time till there is nothing more to X out . Then we will see who is ignorant . I wish this so called creator , instead of hiding , would step out and show him self .
If the world is so complex and ordered that it must have been created by a devine God , then surely God must have been created by an even greater being . How else could such a devine creature exist if not created by an even greater one ? How can you accept the fact that God has always existed , yet you can &apos;t accept the fact that the universe always existed . Where did he exist before creating the universe . If God created the universe , then where does he keep it ? If God is good , all powerfull , and all knowing , yet evil exists . That proves that he either doesn not exist , or that he is not good , all knowing and all powerful , and therefore NOT devine . We are made in his image , yet we are imperfect . Therefore , God is imperfect and therefore NOT devine . All of the religious texts were created by man , so using thems as proof is a fallacy . It &apos;s not as if the good book magically appeared . The STORY of the ten commandments is the only aspect that supposedly was drafted by God himself . He exists because I read it in a book that some man wrote a long time ago . Well there were a lot of books written a long time ago about the supposed ONE creator , and none of them are in agreement . The fact that the three major religions all worship the same God comes from the fact that all three religions came from the same screwed up part of the world that still cannot abide by the teaching of peace found in all three religions . How can you dismiss the many Gods of the Romans , Greeks , Pagans , American Indians , etc . Why didn &apos;t God give these cultures the same teachings as the Middle East ? Their religions ceased not because they were wrong or disproven . They fell by the swords of those who sought to spread their own OPINION on creation and kill those who would not convert to their will .
Rabbi - I don &apos;t see how you have actually justified the existence of a higher being . Your claim that it is the only argument that can provide a full explanation of how the universe came to be is inherently flawed . It doesn &apos;t explain who created the creator which results in infinite regression . That &apos;s one of the most basic problems with religion .Ralfe - Making unsubstantiated generalisations such as &quot; More and more respected academics are seeing the immense flaws in the evolution argument . &quot; doesn &apos;t really help much . Intelligent design uses pseudo- science to come up with a seemingly scientific explanation but all it is really saying is &quot; that physical characteristic is too complex for me to understand so God must have designed it &quot; .
I hear so many who repeat that just because they are not well educated enough to explain evolution it doesn &apos;t exist . Many also feel that because teaching abstinance alone doesn &apos;t work women must be FORCED to bear unwanted children .
We have actual knowledge about how animals came to be and why they show the behaviors they do , especially in relation to reproduction . We also have apparently reliable knowledge of the mechanism of heredity . That contrasts strongly with theological arguments that depend for their rhetorical strength on appealing to the prejudices and ignorance of the Many . Indeed , the Rabbi doesn &apos;t suggest anything at all explanatory . In real explanations , one doesn &apos;t just say that something came to be with x attribute because it was produced by an agent with the same attribute . That &apos;s like arguing that green things are green because they are composed of little green things . Similarly , claiming that man is as he is because he was created by a man-like God doesn &apos;t really explain anything ; and the Rabbi &apos;s reverse move of claiming that the behavior of men allows us to infer the characteristics of God is even more of a stretch . Of course the scientific explanation for the evolution of parental behavior may be in error . On the other hand , there is at least real evidence for it ; and , if it is true , it is an actual explanation instead of an exercise in question begging .
&quot; The absence of proof is not proof of absence . &quot; While fun and flowery , rhetorical devices are no substitute for logic . If the burden of proof is on proving that something does not exist we would be forced to admit the possibility that our every action is indeed guided by a Flying Spaghetti Monster .
Even &quot; possibility &quot; must have supportable reason for claiming it . I must ask you this : is there anything in human discovery and understanding that would even remotely support the possibility of a flying plate of spaghetti with superpowers ? We ought not fling &quot; possibility &quot; about so carelessly.For a thing to be possible , it must follow from what nature is capable of like anything else.Even possibility needs proof . When we attempt to treat what we can only imagine as equal to what we know to be true , we spit in the face of fact and logic and , rather than increasing our awareness , we return to childish sleeping .
I &apos;m really struggling to reconcile the notion of &quot; free will &quot; with the idea that God has a divine plan for us . As far as I can see , only one of them can be right . Which is it ?
&quot; I know it will insult you if I tell you that I will pray for you &quot; Of course it does not . Many of my Christian friends pray for me . And I hope beyond hope that they will shed their mental shackles and one day breathe the air of freedom and truth . To each our own : ) You sound like a standard evangelical Christian , and you just say how much God loves us and how he is wonderful and amazing and all that jazz . I mean , you ignore the fact that your bible is almost completely rewritten by corrupt Catholics in the dark ages , and that every scroll found of the traditional bible is highly contradictory , and none even mentioning the resurrection . ( Yes , nothing pre-Catholic mentions your &apos; savior &apos; ) . But you &apos;ve completely ignored the fact that people create gods . If you can understand why you so easily dismiss those 1,000 other gods , perhaps you can understand why I dismiss the 1001 . God is not a prerequisite for love . God does not love . At best , he is indifferent . I think it &apos;s very righteous of you to think he loves you . Do you presume that he loves the millions of children that starve to death ? Does he love the millions that die of cancer , and other diseases that &apos; he &apos; created ? No &apos; loving &apos; god would create literally thousands of horrific painful deaths . He obviously hand created cancer . Himself . Every part of it . Science believes cancer is a flaw in our evolution , just how we are . But god is flawless , therefore we should be &apos; flawless &apos; as his creation . So , you believe that every horrific disease and death is an example of how wonderful and loving this &apos; god &apos; is ? Honestly that &apos;s kind of sick . If there &apos;s a &apos; he &apos; , he can &apos;t love us . You would never do what he &apos; does &apos; to those you love . Earthquakes and volcanoes and the flu . This world sucks , honestly .
Contrary to the attempts of the religious to make an epistemological equivalence between naturalism and supernaturalism as equally arguable hypotheses to explain nature , there is no such thing as a presumption of naturalism.You are a human being . You have a definite nature , possessing specific characteristics and capabilities , including a human means of gaining knowledge of the world in which you exist . This includes seeing by means of looking with one &apos;s eyes ... and so on for all the senses we possess ... and a rational capacity to identify things by their fundamental characteristics and to form concepts in order to hold our knowledge indefinitely.We are not anything but human beings and , thus , have no other means of gaininging knowledge of the world than our human means.So , if you open your eyes and see nature , that &apos;s where your knowledge begins . There is no mental blank until you first choose your starting assumptions . There are no assumptions that nature , which you see , is nature and that you , somehow , choose to see it onlly in a natural way.Nope. No presumptions whatsoever . You open your eyes , you see what &apos;s there and you begin to mentally organize the evidence provided by your senses into groupings accourding to similarities and differences.You don &apos;t start building your knowledge with nature because you chose that as your presumption . You start building your knowledge with nature , because that is what is there.To go the bizarre and cogintively misguided direction of attributing things that are there to supernatural , meaning unobservable , causes , is what requires an extra action of choosing an assumption , one which veers away from what you observe . Notice that all arguments for the existence of God or for any version of the supernatural require a very abstract organization of concepts and , upon examination , it turns out that there are NO observations which bear out that presumption , nor do the abstract arguments hold to the tests of logic.So , naturalism is nothing more than human beings gaining knowledge of nature by human means , without a naturalist presumption . It is supernaturalism which requires the contruction of a presumption in order to selectively bring observables to the task of proving what is not a valid idea nor an observable reality.Notice that this argument against the &quot; presumption of naturalism &quot; argument required nothing more than the fact that you exist with a specific nature as a human being , including a specific capacity for gaining knowledge . If you wish to quarrel with my argument , you must deny those facts about your existence .
Absence of proof , true , is not proof of absence , however , the absence of proof to support one &apos;s extraordinary claims is proof that one hasn &apos;t done one &apos;s factual homework nor does one appear to be interested in consistently logical reasoning.As I &apos;ve said many times before in debates such as this , one need not disprove any so-called &quot; god &quot; or &quot; goddess &quot; or other claimed related entity . One cannot prove a negative , i.e. non-existence , because one cannot possess all there is to know everywhere and for all of time . What one can do and must do is check the facts and logic of those claiming the existence of such assumed entities . If their facts are incorrect , incomplete or inconsistent and if their logic is poor , one can in the least show the claimants arguments do not support their claims . One can show that the claimant has only very poor to no reason to believe what they do . One need only prove that the claimant has proven nothing at all.Absence of proof is proof the claimant &apos;s arguments - from beginning to their conclusions - are wrong . It makes no statement about the unknown or unknowable .
It just isn &apos;t the case that you can &apos;t prove a negative . Impossibility proofs are common in mathematics . There are lots of them in Euclid . A particular concept of God could indeed be proven self-contradictory and therefore impossible if only anybody were willing to adequately define a God concept . Formerly , philosophers and theologians were able to specify what the hell they were talking about ; but god talk is now merely emotional blather and theologies can &apos;t even properly be said to be wrong . I make an exception for the God concept of sects like Jehovah &apos;s Witness that represent God as a big , powerful animal in the sky , That &apos;s goofy science fiction ; but at least it makes sense ; and the argument against negative arguments does hold in its favor . Maybe a giant bearded tyrant will turn up one of these days .
Your point being ? You are making a claim an illogical god exists without any evidence to support your claim . It &apos;s called burden of proof--you can &apos;t simply claim there is a god and follow up with &quot; You can &apos;t prove me wrong ! So I must be right ! &quot; By the way , I only vote &quot; no &quot; because there is very likely not one . Few atheists really believe there is no god , we simply don &apos;t believe there is one . There &apos;s a difference .
&quot; First , what is the difference between the Unified Force and God ? &quot; The OT , NT , and the body of Christian Theology.It did not create man out of clay , build a garden , drown everyone , part the Red Sea , send it &apos;s only son ... &quot; Second , what caused the Unified Force to break itself apart ? &quot; The cooling / expanding universe.The unified force did not create anything , it was just the force that acted on matter before the universe cooled to the point that it decayed .
When Laplace published his theory of the formation of the Solar System , Napoleon Bonaparte asked him where God fit into his theory . Laplace replied , &quot; Sir , I have no need of that hypothesis . &quot; The answer to your objection should be obvious to logicians : no , it is not absolutely clear that there is no god . Nor is it absolutely clear that there is no Flying Spaghetti Monster or celestial teapot.The answer to &quot; Is there a God ? &quot; cannot be answered definitively , period . Therefore the atheist position is and must be &quot; &#91; with the same likeliness that there is no Flying Spaghetti Monster &#93; there is no god . &quot;
Well , that &apos;s a pretty lame explanation . Who is god trying to impress , himself or us , by creating a universe with billions of galaxies . Just one , the Milky Way , with its 200 to 400 billion stars , would have been impressive enough , particularly since we only realised there were more than one galaxy only in the early 20th century , and we are most unlikely ( what with Einstein &apos;s special theory of relativity , of even visiting the nearest star ( other than the sun ) . Whatever good qualities you find in the bible ( and I admit Proverbs generally is pretty good ) , it is still a pretty shoddy piece of fiction . I don &apos;t know how you can seriously claim your work of fiction is any truer that the sacred texts of any other religion that humans have made up .
I doubt seriously that my dog thinks that I am God . He might be slightly impressed when the front door light comes on automatically , because of the motion detector , when we return at night after a walk , although I think I lose considerable numbers of points , when I fumble around in the dark for the keys , because I forgot to turn on the light in the first place ( he has perfect night vision ) , or even worse , I have to get the garbage bin to climb over the security gate because I forgot its key .
To be a true hypothesis you have to be able to devise experiments by which you can demonstrate if it is correct or not . Radio waves ( tv and wireless signals are all in the radio spectrum ) cannot be seen , but can be detected and proven to exist .
&quot; 1 . You do not have instrumentation that can detect them and and relay that information in a manner that our 5 senses can sense them . &quot; yes , that is true ... however considering that we know that there are radio broadcasts going on near by ( even though I do not have my cell phone on me I know that it gets a signal where I am sitting ) I don &apos;t think that it is unreasonable to assume that there are radio waves passing through me right now . &quot; 2 . If you do not have that instrumentation tuned into the frequency those energy signals are transmitting on . &quot; That is a strange way to put it ... but again , yes . &quot; 3 . There may be many other energy waves than radio tv infra red ultra violet light rays . &quot; getting stranger now , but also true ... there are sound waves to consider for one . &quot; Thought waves for example , we cannot even read thought waves &quot; Que ? It depends on what you mean by &apos; Thought Waves &apos; ... if you are talking about the frequency of electrical signals traveling through the brain you are correct in that we cannot &apos; read &apos; them . We can detect them but we cannot interpret them . &quot; who knows what other energy signals are out there that we simply cannot detect withn our current detection facilities . &quot; Also true , however that reasoning allows for an infinite number of possibilities ... We &apos; could &apos; be organic robots controlled by tachyon signals being projected from Saturn . &quot; Just because you don &apos;t know its there does not mean it doesn &apos;t exist . &quot; Can &apos;t the same thing be said for Unicorns and underwear gnomes ?
An odd objection , seeing as your argument is God exists .
It is an assertion , not an argument . Regardless of whether one is open to the possiblity of God &apos;s existence , it is quite a stretch to assert that it is clear that a being with those god -like characteristics does not exist .
You claim to have an objection to the statement &quot; matter cannot be created or destroyed &quot; yet show no evidence to the contrary.The icing on the cake of your &quot; argument &quot; seems to be blindly asserting that god isnt improbable ; again without any proof or explanation.Care to provide some ?
Matter is not destroyed when it enters a black hole ... it adds to the mass.There are questions about entropy in relation to black holes ... specifically do black holes &apos; destroy &apos; information .
Can you elaborate on that statement ? Energy is such a broad term after all.If I carry a ball up to the top of a hill does it gain mass ? Does a photon have mass ?
Good is the health , well-being and longevity of our entire species and planet . You can believe in a god and be for the good of all humanity or you can not believe in god and be for the good of all humanity . On the other hand saddling people with original sin , the fall of man and a final judgment day is definitely not good for the psychic of humankind . If we become extinct through our own suicidal self-destructive tendencies taught to us by people who claim to believe in god , will it be god &apos;s fault ? Therefore the Abrahamic god and all gods are irrelevant compared to love .
Of course not . There &apos;s no evidence for any kind of entity that somehow stands outside of existence and &quot; creates &quot; it.One should recognize that matter cannot be created or destroyed . It is . It always was and always will be . Matter changes its form but it does not cease to exist . The notion of God goes back to pre-historic times when men sought an explanation for the universe and its contents . It was an understandable thing to do . But now thanks to many geniuses---philosophers such as Aristotle and Ayn Rand and scientists such as Galileo and Newton---we &apos;ve come to understand much about the universe and about the nature of man and how he learns and the legitimate forms of knowledge . There is still much to learn . To learn it , we certainly should put aside ancient myths . Mysticism always leads to brutality . Faith and force go together . Those not dedicated to reason seek to force others to believe as they do . Religion is an immoral institution and it starts with the notion that some omnipotent , infallible god in on somebody &apos;s side and others must be forced to believe it . Consider the Crusades , the Inquisition , the witch hunts and today &apos;s latest &quot; fad &quot; suicide bombers . All these kill themselves and others in the name of their god . No , Virginia , there is no God . Human beings are responsible for their actions . Nature is a wonderful benevolent place . But as Lord Bacon said , &quot; To command nature , we must obey it . &quot; So one should put all one &apos;s intellectual effort into understanding it and leave off with the wishful thinking and fantasies of religions .
Zebrakin appears to be a believer and that no amount of reasoned argument will change his mind.However , in the event that I &apos;m wrong and that I can change his mind , I point out that it is a mistake to consider being convinced of something is the same as believing something . The concept conviction is an intellectual conclusion based usually on a lengthy examination of the facts of reality . The concept belief is an abandonment of the intellect and an acceptance of what others have asserted without evidence or proof . Belief is ultimately based on wishes , and requires self-abnegation . Conviction is based on logic and requires self-assertion . Zebrakin states that I consider belief &quot; pathetic foolishness . &quot; Okay , but not accurate . In this day and age , I consider religious belief to be the most lethal form of brute force that men have invented . It stunts one &apos;s consciousness and tears it in two , attributing one &apos;s best to the non-existent and requiring one regard oneself as sacrificial fodder for the benefit of others . It is a boon to man &apos;s rational faculty that he can marvel at the beauty of the universe . But that is not &quot; in born . &quot; Such an estimate arises from a fundamental regard of nature as benevolent and of man as heroic . That this is true is shown by the fact that many men do not regard the universe with wonder , nor look upon man as basically good . Instead they regard nature as a threat and man as basically evil . The better philosophers , such as Aristotle and Ayn Rand , have answered the questions you raise . ( &quot; to discover where &#91; men &#93; have come from , where they go to , and why they are here . &quot; ) Many scientists , such as archeologists and physicists , have helped by adding factual details . I sense in your closing statement a melancholy I should like to tell you is not necessary to feel . You wrote : &quot; Perhaps we feel we have to find answers to these questions because somewhere we know that there &apos;s more to this life . &quot; A proper moral code , found in Ayn Rand &apos;s philosophy of Objectivism , shows that one need not wish that life is somehow better beyond the grave where men will find true happiness . One can find true happiness here on earth while we live . But to do so requires courage to face the reality that you have far greater intellectual strength than your religion tells you , far greater wealth of spirit that your beliefs suggest you possess , and that you are far superior in value to those you are taught to sacrifice yourself for . You can find happiness now by rejecting the moral code of your religion and discovering the rational moral code of Objectivism , which briefly put says your life belongs to you and the good is to live it rationally . May I suggest you read Ayn Rand &apos;s novels ? ---Especially Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead . In addition to being wonderfully original stories , they will help you to re-discover what your religion may have caused you to loose .
I apologize , this is not much of a response to your work . I am tired . I should not really be writing now ... but I just want to say a couple of things ... the belief in God or a god or gods is quaint . There is now extensive neuroscientific &quot; evidence &quot; for &quot; god on the brain &quot; which neither proves nor disproves anything much ... but it is interesting to see how the brain functions . I take all human knowledge to be human constructions ( we can only see what humans can see ; we can only hear what humans can hear etc etc ) . We can only think or imagine what humans can think or imagine . Anything beyond the scope of our brains is by definition unknowable . If there was a god we could not possibly know it . In the same sense that no human being can possibly know everything that is going on in the universe . God , is apparently , bigger than the universe , after all he , she or it made the universe , so he she or it must be bigger ( in some sense ) and therefore as a mere humanoid I cannot know him her or it . And it would not make a blind bit of difference even if he she or it did exist ... the world is just the same ... Hamas , Al-Qaeda , the US military all still exist , they are all still torturing and killing each other . All the people doing compassionate loving helpful things in the world are also still there . If god is there or if god is not there ... there is no difference . Perhaps , the new US President will help bring some peace into this world , I certainly hope so , but even he cannot bring a non-existent god into existence .
As a scientist and skeptic of religion , I am offended by this inane post . Where to start ? &quot; everything we know about science would have to be wrong &quot; First , the areas of science and the scientific method that would be affected by a revelation depend entirely on the specific powers of the g ( G ) od in question.Second , most of what we currently &quot; know &quot; as scientists is wrong to some degree . Science is a path to understanding , but don &apos;t get on a high horse about how great we are . We are just getting started . &quot; Absent proof that matter and Energy can be created , there is no reason to doubt science in favor of a wish &quot; We know that matter and energy can interconvert . A lot of miracles could happen that way . As pointed out by jdefriez , it is a false premise to say that god is equivalent to the creation of matter and energy.I believe you are refuting a specific God , perhaps the God required to accomplish the literal word of the bible . Even with such an easy target you have mishandled the argument and discredited your own side with your fallacious appeals to authority . You can &apos;t even preach to the converted .
even those who say they believe it god do not believe they are just frightened to what will happen to them when they die.I do not thing a poll is correct.They have not asked everyone .
Those examples you gave are things that we can demonstrate to others . The sun feels warm , produces light , we can measure all of it &apos;s attributes . If you are going to claim that because literally every person could have a completely different way of conceiving god that that would mean that God is everything to everyone . He can be anything you want him / her / it to be ! So which is more likely : an amorphous being that is beyond description and consistently contradictory ... or a figment of our imaginations ? Ponder that one .
Since there are an enormous number of God concepts floating around , one could hardly disprove them all . For that matter , some people define God as having a positive attitude towards lile . Can &apos;t disagree with that ! However , If by God , you refer to a being greater than which one cannot conceive , I argue that such a being does not exist.Nothing is ever as good as you think it will be . It follows that the being greater than which one cannot conceive cannot actually exist because it would therefore be less than another being that was like the first but non existent . Therefore there is no God .
I agree mostly with your reasoning on why religion attacks science , but i don &apos;t think most people realize that this argument is showing up as supporting belief in god . Since it wasn &apos;t tagged , I think it is getting a lot of &apos; i wish we could all get along &apos; points but giving them to the supporting position . This may be a problem with the site counting points for non-tagged arguments for one-side or the other .
I think many people have decided god does not exist becasue many attributes assigned to god have been successfully explained by science. god doesn &apos;t have to exist to explain earthquakes , asteroids , lightning , etc .
You &apos;re assuming things happen for a reason . Could it not all be chance ?
if you believe the bible is wrong what are you going on that god ( or a higher being ) exists ?
While religion attacks science , science must defend itself . We saw life without learning in the middle ages . Bad , weren &apos;t they ? Therefore , trying to hide fact because a book , supposedly written by a god that has not been proven , is an attack on learning and science . Why should we go simply with what the bible says ? That is why people bring science and religion into comparison , because as one disproves parts of the other , the other sticks to its dogma and tries to ban science . That is wrong .
Look kids ! He started with the watchmaker argument ! Please , please , please , stop using arguments that have been proven to be flawed over and over and over ! This is the problem that theists have when convincing atheists that there is a god of some sort , you don &apos;t use good arguments.Anyway , to disprove that argument , we recognize that things like jeans , laptop , and WATCHES have a creator because that &apos;s the culture that we &apos;ve been brought up in . We know that they have a creator because there &apos;s no method through which they could &apos;ve come together other than that . But for the complexities of our bodies , the spiders , and the sea shells , we have explained methods by which they reach their complexity ( evolution ) .The main problem that I have with the watchmaker argument is the inherent fundamentalist theistic blindness that it displays . On the surface , it simply shows the theist ignoring scientific evidence ( which is a bit of a euphemism , I &apos;ve realized . Let &apos;s make this clear : evidence means we &apos;ve SEEN IT HAPPEN ) , but then you dive deeper and it shows how much the belief in a god ( I didn &apos;t capitalize it because I wasn &apos;t referring to the Abrahamic God ) can blind a person to the flaws in their argument . You &apos;re stating that a god ( which most people say is perfect ) created the universe ( perfectly ) . You &apos;re arrogant enough to assume that this universe was created for humans , one of the stupidest assertions you can make . If a god exists , he &apos;s a damn shitty one for creating all this useless crap around us ( the whole universe that we don &apos;t really need ) . Why wouldn &apos;t a god give us better , longer lasting , stronger bodies ? Why wouldn &apos;t a god make the universe centered around us if we were what he created it for ? Why wouldn &apos;t we be living in a metaphorical &quot; Garden of Eden &quot; ? Here &apos;s the answer : because a god doesn &apos;t exist.Also , why do you assert that the christian God created the universe ?
What evidence is there that everything didnt happen by chance ? Dont things happen to people by chance every day , or is everything that happens , good or bad , God &apos;s plan ? Though i do realize that it &quot; feels &quot; good to think that there is a creator than that everything happened by chance , whether or not the former is true is always up for debate . I am currently in a battle within myself , especially after reading Thomas Paine &apos;s Age of Reason , even though it is a totally deistic view of religion . The FACT is , God didnt give us a book called the Bible , the Catholic church found the Books in the Bible and decided which books would be called the Word of God , with no chance of debating the actual existence of such a thing .
In the car analogy , &quot; crashing &quot; together is instantaneous.It took literally trillions of years for our universe to become the way it is and throughout that time things have gradually developed . Human life didn &apos;t spawn out of nowhere , that &apos;s what YOU believe , that man was crushed from dirt , if you actually believe Genesis . What science actually supposes is that multiple forms of life exist down to the simplest level , we &apos;ve recorded and documented the process of evolution in current years , there are fossils that point exhaustively at a common ancestor , and that life gradually developed up to our level , each predecessor and prototype sustaining itself .
Once again . In response to the video , which stated that there are two ultimatums , 1 . Either everything came from nothing , or 2 . Something always existed . All you did was assume everything came from somewhere , placed God before all of this , and closed off the causality chain with the exact opposite argument .
Ok , so the Bible says the descendants of the Israelis will reunite . That one happened . But the other predictions are just absurd . &quot; Europe , revived roman empire , to be the final world government . EU gives rise to Antichrist , who will come out of Spain ( 10th nation of EU ) and form a peace contract with Israel for 7 years . &quot; How is Europe the revived Roman Empire ? Even if we pretend that it is , there &apos;s no way Europe is going to take over the entire world . &quot; 666 : mark of the Antichrist - a biometric identification system that will facilitate commerce . &quot; Seriously ? I can &apos;t believe people up-voted this crap .
You , Me , Life the World , the Universe is proof of You , Me , Life the World , the Universe - not god . &quot; Where did that little ball of matter that exploded come from &quot; - god only shifts the question to where did god come from. if god is allowed to exist forever , then why wouldn &apos;t something simpler .
With that kind of logic you could pretend like anything you want really exists . You could pretend that you will find a hundred dollars every day for the rest of your life based on no evidence at all , but that wouldn &apos;t make it happen .
When in sexual arousal the body releases phenylethylamines , these produce the feeling of love . Love can easily be explained by science through biology and chemistry , that might sound cold , but I don &apos;t believe it makes it any less beautiful .
all humans existed becoz of the improved science and moder techniques ......... its true that it is very impossible without any creator , people would exist in this world but I say that it is SCIENCE the creator
what makes me feel more and more correct that there is no god is that the explanations just boil down to &quot; of course he &#91; exists &#93; &quot;
ludacris ad hominem assertion by someone who , of course , presents no evidence for his argument
... therefore God exists . The logic is inescapable ! Oh , wait , no , I forgot ... the difficulty of holding a belief has nothing to do with it &apos;s validity . Silly me !
&quot; I don &apos;t see why God couldn &apos;t have just set evolution in motion . &quot; Because according to the bible god created all of the various species at the time of creation . This makes evolution impossible .
I &apos;ve indulged this debate for over two decades and its essence boils down to this - We need not debate the existence of a &quot; god &quot; . The true debate is whether or not those who claim the existence of such have sufficient evidence and reason to support their claims.Do claimants of the existence of a &quot; god &quot; have sufficient evidence and argument to support what they claim ? That &apos;s the more relevant question.I cannot reject a &quot; god &quot; whose existence has never been conclusively proven and accepted . What I reject is the weak or absent evidence and the poorly reasoned arguments for such .
Just a flaw with your initial argument . &quot; Suppose they are . That is , suppose there is no Uncaused Being , no God . Then nothing could exist right now . For remember , on the no-God hypothesis , all things need a present cause outside of themselves in order to exist . &quot; That &apos;s assuming time has a finite beginning . If you believe that God is and always was , and considering that we don &apos;t see time having an end , then why does time ( an infinite dimension , therefore ) have to have a beginning ?
this is my first argument : ahem ... atheists and theists are two sides of the same coin. one is certain there is a god , the other is certain there is not .. both have intelligent people. i have not seen god , but if i do ...
I am a 100 % atheist because there is NO evidence of a god , heaven , hell , devils , angels or a soul that leaves the body . They are ALL figments of our imagination . Heaven is an attractive illusion . All thoughts about god exist only in our minds . Look for evidence and you will find none . All animals and plants came about because of evolution which has been going on for 3.5 billion years on Earth.Jimmy Dunne 281.584.9707
Meaning that if you want to , it can mean anything you want to . There are no hidden meanings in the bible . If anything most people have no understanding of the bible because they don &apos;t understand the historical context when each of the books were written . Like how there is no record of Hebrew slaves in Egypt , but we know the old testament was first solidified in Babylon when they were slaves there . To say the bible is &quot; written by God &quot; immediately discredits you in any real discussion about the bible due to your own ignorance .
god created animals then man and woman in Gen 1 : 24-27 but he created man first , then animals , then woman in Gen 2 : 18-22God told Noah to take a male and female of every animal Gen 6 : 19-20 and four verses later says to bring 7 pairs of every clean animal and 2 of animals that are not clean Gen 7 : 2Even the lineage of Jesus doesn &apos;t get further than Joseph and Mary without contradicting itself
I don &apos;t believe in God , because there is no proof . And please don &apos;t say well there is no proof he doesn &apos;t exist , because under that same theory all criminals should just be sent to jail , because there is no proof that they didn &apos;t commit the crime , why don &apos;t we just forget about free trial ? I refuse to believe in God until proof presents itself .
I do not believe in god as a &quot; god &quot; like the bible describes him to be . To me , &quot; god &quot; is the power above us . It cannot speak , hear us or give us advice of any sort .
No . God is only the conscience in your own head . The conscience is looking out for you , so pay attention to it !
I was born christian and brought up in catholic school . Later on i realised the rubbish that religion is . Most religions are a group of people coming together to nod at a wall for an hour . All the main religions grow for one reason ; Child indoctrination . Christianity did it throughout the 1700 &apos;s , stealing children from their families &quot; baptising them &quot; and bringing them up as fanatics . All religions grab the attention of young children with false promises and teach them to ignore and hate all other points of view . Religion is just indoctrination , hitler did it exactly the same way religion did it and it must be stopped . There is no need for a god . Evolution says there isn &apos;t and thanks to the missing link being proved yesterday ir is proven and there is no argument against it apart from the usual religious argument of shouting No repeatedly until you go away . God has no place in this universe the only evidence of his existence are old books written by men. probably insane men .
No , there &apos;s no evidence . Why not believe in pink unicorns as well ? And teapots ? And Santa ? I guess these are all pretty cliche arguments , but why be content with not understanding the world when you can ?
&quot; I have a scientific bachelor &apos;s degree and I know that scientists do &quot; make stuff up &quot; = &quot; postulate &quot; . It &apos;s the first step in the process . &quot; They only make anything up because of observations in reality that need explanation . Then they test the explanation via scientific observations or experiments . Religion does not do this next step . Within religion , they say , &quot; This suits me to believe , therefore I will follow it . &quot; Science does not allow for such wishful thinking .
Just because you were brainwashed as a child does not objectively prove anything , period .
yes but not as a all know figur that can do anything. god is that thing in the back of you head that is telling you to vote up this argument .
This post is the DEFINITION of circular &quot; logic &quot; . It is completely foolish on the face of it !
never been proved to me , ever. he / she / it only exists in the minds of those who feel they need to be told what to do or what to believe .
There is no evidence to support any god. it is that plain and simple . Like Carol Sagan said &quot; Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence &quot; For the claim that there is an almighty supreme being there should be all kinds of evidence , but there isn &apos;t a shred of evidence .
Believing in any religion specific God is foolish because that belief has no rational foundation .
No offense , but I don &apos;t believe that there is a &quot; spirit &quot; up there who created the world in 6 days , or about Adam and Eve with the apple tree . I believe in the big bang , not the Bible .
Actually that &apos;s not entirely true . The only account of Jesus Christ is the one found in the Bible . Historians have searched for other proof of his existence and found none .
&quot; If the universe has laws as you say , then you must be intellectually honest enough to say that those laws had to come from somewhere . &quot; Fair enough . Scientists are smart enough to hypothesize on what we don &apos;t know and most importantly , able to admit that we just plain don &apos;t know . What we do know is that some silly sky wizard who preaches his own perfection while immaturely committing genocide against entire populations did not create this world.Holy texts are rife with errors and out right lies . As for your other bit : &quot; An interesting argument indeed . Why does science have laws ? Why do we accept that there is a natural order ( design ? ) . &quot; Order DOES NOT equal DESIGN . That &apos;s the worst misconception I &apos;ve heard yet . There is no order in nature . There is chaos.Our universe is the expenditure of energy and mass towards entropy ( chaos ) . Natural selection and evolution happen randomly , chaotically . Everything is chaos - pure and simple . Just because there appears to be order in chaos ...
Beginning in the 19th century historians began to investigate whether there was any actual historical evidence of Jesus . James Frazer was the first to really study Christianity dispassionately . He found that Christmas comes from a pagan tradition , and early Christians piggybacked their holiday on it . He also discovered that the idea of a reborn god ( like the story of Jesus ) exists in many primitive religions and cultures . He discovered it comes from crops dying and growing again . Eventually he came to the conclusion that there is no evidence for Jesus having ever existed.After hearing this , the Catholic church took the position that their beliefs were not based on evidence but faith alone .
So it was made up ?
But the Bible says that &apos;s okay ! The logic is flawless .
the &quot; grounding question &quot; only tries to play semantic word games - if someone asks why a god would allow &apos; evil &apos; then they seize upon the word evil and say that for objective evil to exist means god has to exist . The argument is silly since using any word but &apos; objective evil &apos; defeats it ( pain , suffering , collectively agreed upon evil , etc . ) Put 100 devout people in separate rooms and ask them 100 moral questions ( e.g. if a pregnant woman has cancer , can she get chemotherapy to likely save her life if it would likely kill the baby ? ) - you will get many different answers and different justifications - so if there is objective morality , humans cannot converse with god and figure out what it is.We would still be left with subjective morality only we would be judged by a god who has an objective morality and sends people to the lake of fire based on a morality they can &apos;t know .
Whether or not there is a god doesn &apos;t matter . There is , or there isn &apos;t . What matters is whether the existence of god is relevant to our lives . Obviously , if there &apos;s no god , it is not relevant.Just as clear : if there is a god , we can never know its nature ( or alternatively , we can only understand god through faith without proof ; same thing . ) This is the only possible way to explain the complete lack of real evidence.If there is a god , but we can never know its nature , then the only way we can get some relevance from god is to believe in a version of god that is relevant . But this version is a complete guess ! That &apos;s self-delusion ; instead we ought to just think honestly about what is morally right and wrong.Another way to think about it : if god &apos;s relevance is to give us a moral code , then either the moral code is right in itself ( in which case we don &apos;t need god to get it ) or , the moral code is arbitrary and we should ignore it .
... one moment before he calls you a heretic . Oh well , I would rather be cursed than blessed by a priest .
Naturally , for something to exist we must be able to either observe the god itself or observe other things that prove its existence . I know my dog exists because I can see him , touch him , etc . It is extremely reasonable to believe electrons exist because of the massive amount of observable indirect evidence for their existence.Now , obviously we cannot directly experience god . We cannot see him , touch him , etc . Therefore , we must observe indirect evidence of his existence . Unfortunately , there is none . The only &quot; evidence &quot; religious people use is attempting to DISPROVE the big bang , evolution , etc -- not PROVE that THEIR side is correct . Why ? Because they have no evidence . No archaeological evidence for a Garden of Eden , no direct link between prayer and healing , etc . Suppose there is a god . For something to exist , it or evidence for it must be observable . However , neither a god nor evidence for a god &apos;s existence can be observed . Therefore , a god does not exist .
&quot; never put anyone to death for not believing in him &quot; - HA ! anyone who doesn &apos;t believe in him gets eternal damnation
&quot; I have never known of any Christian who is a firm believing to ask for anybody to be put to death . &quot; - if Osama bin Laden was caught tomorrow how many people would be speaking out for him not to be killed ?
Also , you do err in your inference that I implied you believe in God.Oh yeah ... A lot of bs ... Your debate is nothing more than the illustration of demagoguery without the use of the word demagoguery while at the same time a debate about whether or not a demagogue should use the word God .Finally , we have a winner ! .. Kinda . You &apos;re right . ( although I never knew the word demagoguery ) Right so you DO know what my debate is about , but I don &apos;t know you &apos;re position.So it &apos;s kinda useless to argue when you don &apos;t have a position .
&quot; If Intelligent Design is correct it would be wise to find out for what purpose we were created &quot; - how would you go about doing that ? even with a god , what is your higher purpose , live a life of suffering that the god had provided you while loving that god ?
There is zero evidence of any Gods being real.All Gods and all religions are human fabrications.Fabrications perpetrated by the least sane members of our human collections . Volcanos are not Gods or Goddesses . Thunder is not due to Zeus throwing lightning bolts around , nor Thor throwing his magic hammer at angry giants . Bushes are not gods , ( even though &quot; W &quot; thinks he is . ) Pillars of fire are not Gods , &amp; doves do not impregnate underage Palestinian women . From Anubis , Osiris , and Ra to Zoraster , Zeus , and Odin , and on to Cheeseus Crust , YawhnAway , AllahtaSwaller , and Baba Yaga , Ron Regan , W , and Paris Hilton ... Gods are , and always have been , HUMAN CONSTRUCTS ... The evidence is clear though , that only the most credulous , weak minded , gullible , irrational , lead poisoned , inbread , and saddly brainwashed of our human tribe believe that there ever was or is such a thing as a &quot; God &quot; .
nah uh - is not a valid argument against what someone says
I think I see the problem here.You live on a different planet.1. again , there &apos;s 0 proof Christians give any more to charity than anyone else . Where are your statistics ? There &apos;s no reason to think that Christians give more than a Muslim , Jew , Buddhist , or Atheist . There &apos;s no proof . It &apos;s your opinion , and your opinion is not based on anything at all.2. If tomorrow god came and took all the Christians I &apos;d be super glad because you guys are annoying . That aside though , there &apos;s no such thing so unfortunately it &apos;s not going to happen . If it did though , everyone would get along just fine . I mean , you people didn &apos;t even start showing up on this planet until 300 years after that guy Jesus ( who may have never even existed ) died , and everything was just peachy without you.3. Yeah , god is a private thing , and you have the right to believe in god or the easter bunny or big foot or whatever the hell you want . Problem is , Christians don &apos;t want religious freedom you nuts want everyone to believe your own insanity . But nope , sorry , the constitution is clear . Church and State are separate , and god should not be in public schools in any form whatsoever . Start your own school if you don &apos;t like it , but don &apos;t try to put it on everyone else.3. So when something bad happens like 9 / 11 we all of a sudden ask God why did he remove his protection . Total HypocrisyYou dumbass . 9 / 11 had nothing to do with &quot; god &apos;s protection &quot; it was terrorists.God has never stopped a single tragedy in the history of the world , and he &apos;s not about to start just because you force your silly beliefs on other people.And your insinuation that somehow people die because of what they believe is not only incredibly stupid . But offensive , evil , and frankly why so many bright people like myself have gone from indifferent about your silly cult , to downright hating it .
I haven &apos;t downvoted you in days , man . &quot; Fed to the lions &quot; ? Because people disagree with you ? Oh please.You sound a wee bit paranoid , mate . I &apos;m not downvoting you , and nobody is &quot; persecuting &quot; you either . You &apos;ve been quite free to express your opinions . If you don &apos;t like the fact that people can respond to your opinions by voting them up or down or by posting their own counter-arguments , you are in the wrong forum .
Sources please.I fail to see anything in this semi-literate rant that would convince me you have any idea what you are talking about .
It comes as no suprise that you sound like a moron , because to believe the point you &apos;re trying to make you would in fact have to be a moron ... realize that . Now what do you have to say for the people living in the horrible places of the world who never see one ounce of joy . Why has &quot; god &quot; neglected the people of North Korea and just chose to give us happiness and swimming , and football , and walking with our girlfriends . Ha you are so naive it &apos;s pathetic
Why should you be good for the sake of being good ? because you would have a deeper and more educated understanding of the needs for kindness ( for example ) for you and your peers in this world . Education allows us to understand our importance in this world , not just as individuals but as members of a society . My well-being in this world depends on how well I am able to relate to others . Education allows me to see that some actions cause harm to my peers and this is undesirable because , through education , I have attained an understanding about their personal dignity . I do not do things based on some reward , I do things based on a practical ( and scientific ) understanding on the consecuences of actions . Morality becomes objective and factual , not subjective like most religions that impose rules and norms only because &quot; God says so &quot; . Religious morality for example has been changing over time , proving that it is as subjective as any other type of opinion. the bible itself contains examples of the changes that occurr in the laws given to the people . At one point in time christians were not allowed to eat animals with hoofs , however this changed over time . We cannot base our concepts in books that change with the interpretations given to them . If we are looking for a solid conception of what the greater good is , we should find it in science and factual evidence as to what really is right or wrong behavior based on whether or not it is harmful to us .
You sir , are sick in the head and should be isolated from the rest of society for the greater good . What you &apos;re saying is that god is the ultimate punishment and the only way people can have a sense of direction is through him . That is utter bullshit.I honestly don &apos;t know how else I can say that.People don &apos;t need a god . People need other people to guide them .
Ofcourse People need other people to guide them . THAT IS WHY GOD SENDS DOWN PROPHETS . They are there to tell people God &apos;s word.If god were real then he could just tell people himself . This is ridiculous logic.Let me repeat - GOD IS NOT JUST THE ULTIMATE &apos; PUNISHMENT &apos; . HE IS ALL . HE LOVES YOU THE MOST , HE GUIDES YOU THE BEST , HE DOES EVERYTHING BETTER THAN ANYBODY IN REAL LIFE CAN . THAT IS WHY HE IS GOD . If you have an IQ above 50 you would understand what I &apos;m saying . So far you haven &apos;t.Um , name one thing god has done in the history of mankind and you may have an argument here.So doesn &apos;t that mean by following somebody who knows all is the right way in life ? ... I don &apos;t know about you , but to me I would follow somebody who knew everything and would do the best for me rather than to follow somebody who knew quite a bit and would do the best for me . ANYdayProblem is , there is no god who knows everything . I mean , even the books of any religion that were supposed to come from this mythical being are riddled with contradiction . I mean , wouldn &apos;t an all knowing everything at least not contradict themself ? The only real excuse one can make is &quot; well , it was written by man . &quot; Well in that case , if it &apos;s ultimately just other people you &apos;re listening to anyway when you are &quot; hearing the word of god &quot; why bother with a god at all in that case ? Why not just have people ? - since that &apos;s all it is anyway even by the admission of the religious .
So if people are good in general , then they should probably make good choices . If they &apos;re not making good choices , then they &apos;re not really good in general , now are they ? If you give a man a knowledge of good and evil , regardless of his beliefs , he &apos;ll know what good and evil are . Whether or not his concept of good and evil are the same is up to him , isn &apos;t it ? Society however , has the power to control the outliers and people who just don &apos;t get it.Well as far as murder and other really dumb shit to pull , it &apos;s usually considered bad if you &apos;re ending up hurting people and / or the community in general by doing it . I don &apos;t need a god to tell me that shooting someone is a bad idea , or that it &apos;s going to hurt somebody . And yeah , sometimes it is justified . There are some people in this world that need to die because they &apos;re a cancer.Adultery ? Well , that &apos;s a personal choice thing now isn &apos;t it . Whether or not someone chooses to care who their mate has sex with is up to them . Most of the time people get really pissed off at that thing . If you enter a relationship where your mate would care , it &apos;s probably a bad idea to go fooling around.I honestly do understand everything you are saying , you &apos;re being thick headed .
If you care about the greater good , you stick by it . You don &apos;t lie to get people to buy your greater good , you explain why they should . If still they decline , you keep pushing . If you know why your greater good is great , you &apos;ll be able to sell it to anyone without a single lie.Church is to the mind , what a prison is to the body .
If the end justifies the means , then the &quot; greater good &quot; is violated through the way , then I don &apos;t think we are talking about a greater good anymore . If the greater good is to tell the truth , and in order to do things you need to tell people a lie , then there is no more greater good present . Maybe historically it has been erratically believed that we need some sort of mythical creature in order to be &quot; good &quot; . But I do not think that this &quot; greater good &quot; has brought much greatness to humanity in the long run , as it has given way to horrible things through fanatism and it has perpetuated lack of education in many areas related to science . It has also allowed governments to control populations through the use of those beliefs . It has also fostered artificial divisions between different cultures , eventualy leading to wars . Are these means justifiable ? and are the followers really giving our world a greater good ? I don &apos;t think we need God anymore to know what is good or bad . I think people are capable to figure things out on their own .
Not their understanding , but word for word , God &apos;s Words1 . I just wonder how it is that some people have a direct line to &quot; know &quot; what god wants and what god says. there is no reason to see Buddha , Jesus or Muhammad as anything more than just very intelligent guys who had a burden in their hearts to guide people into a right moral pathway . Anyone with common sense and enough passion , and charisma can do this . Ghandi did not claim to be speaking god &apos;s words. he did claim to be inspired by the words of said prophets but by viewing their words as what he called &quot; pure thoughts &quot; . why do you have to bring a &quot; god &quot; into the picture ? morality has no need for god . 2. the words of the prophets you cite have value , but i feel that because they claim to be god-sent , their words become meaningless. people then have to choose who to believe ... was jesus the son of god ? or was he just a prophet ? ... then religion becomes more than just about morality but about being &quot; right &quot; with some &quot; god &quot; . does the mother of your example have to tell the kid that she is letting him fall because god told her to ? why cant she just explain the logic behind it ? it is enough .... we know that we shouldnt kill because it is common sense ! not because we have to believe in someone who tells us that god talked to them last night . Since you do not want to use religion , then explain how the idea of god , outside of religious norms , is tied to morality. it seems that more than defending the need for having a creator / god , you are defending the need for organized religion . God could be viewed as something more sublime than an organized set of rules written down by some privileged men who had some sort of direct phone line to the all-mighty .... in my opinion morality need not to be tied to god. your argument is very confusing. are you defending religion , or god , or morality as means for the greater good ? ... it seems to me that you believe that religions are legitimate creations of a god. if this is the case , this will be my last comment to you as there are too many contradictions in religions , in their norms , to even begin to accept that a higher being would have given them to us for our &quot; guidance &quot; . if there was a higher being he probably has nothing to do with religions ... and i repeat ... morality does not need to be tied to a god. there are lot of ways to be educated into the &quot; right &quot; way of behaving that do not require having someone telling you that you will go to hell if you don &apos;t obey .
It is good to get back on track . ; ) If they &apos;re NOT , then why have they &apos; used &apos; God ? I honestly think that the answer is a simple lack of education . Whereas before people had to be threatened with floods and the wrath of a god to compel them to change their ways , now that we have more understanding about the world , we are able to find logical conclusions as to how we should act in certain situations. we are now able to think more critically about issues because we have more knowledge . Regarding the questions you post on the thou shalt not kill example , using the concept of god inhibits our critical thinking about how to solve such situations . The &quot; word of god &quot; is usually not enough to address such issues about euthanasia , abortion in case of rape , killing in war , or self defense . I seriously doubt that god will tell us the right answer no matter what . Whereas we can be allowed to arrive at logical conclusions about the issues of killing on a case to case basis , I dont think that we can know god &apos;s answers about these issues based on things that were written hundreds of years ago . Unless , again , you can prove that you have a direct line to god and that he is telling you what to do . This would be very subjective and you would have a hard time applying it to all of society . There was a case in Nicaragua a couple of years ago , where an 11 year old girl was raped , and because she had reached puberty , she got pregnant . In Nicaragua , people believe that the bible is the word of god . Churches of different denominations interpret this word for the people . However , the god had not mentioned anything about what to do in this situation ... no mention of abortion . So churches , who claimed to know what god was saying , launched a fierce campaign against the abortion of the child ... based on the fact that if the bible ( the word of god ) said thou shalt not kill then this applies in any situation and we shouldn &apos;t think critically about each issue and respond to it accordingly . The girl was 11 years old and incapable of taking care of the baby . The family of the girl lost the support of the community because they wanted the daughter to abort . The girl did not even understand what was going on . .... Anyway , just an example of how claiming that god says something can not be for the greater good . If the girl asks why she shouldn &apos;t be allowed to abort the answer will be because god says so . This kind of answer in itself is detrimental to the advancement of our own development of ethics and morality.I don &apos;t claim that educated people make good choices all the time , only that when we have more knowledge about situations , our choice will be more informed and this expands the possibility that it will be a better choice than an uninformed one . If we become more informed then we will solve the problem of just being like children who do not understand and need to follow blindly . This may have been the case in times when people thought that the world stood on pilars , but now we don &apos;t need more myths , we need more education so we can think critically about the impact of our desicions .
